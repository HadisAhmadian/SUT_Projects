INT. BEDROOM, FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
A man WAKES, nightmare SWEATY. This is COOPER.
                    YOUNG GIRL’S VOICE
               (O.S.)
          Dad? Dad?
Cooper turns: in the doorway - his sleepy ten-year-old
daughter. This is MURPH.

                    COOPER
          Sorry. Go back to sleep.
                    MURPH
          I thought you were the ghost.

                    COOPER
          There’s no ghost, Murph.
                    MURPH
          Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

                    COOPER
          Maybe Grandpa’s a little too close
          to being one himself. Back to
          sleep.
                    MURPH
          Were you dreaming about the crash?
                    COOPER
          Back to sleep, Murph.

Murph shuffles back out the door. Cooper moves to the
window. DAWN breaks over an ENDLESS SEA OF CORN ...
                                                       3.


                    ELDERLY FEMALE VOICE
               (V.O.)
          Corn, sure. But dust. In your ears,
          your mouth...

          Dust just everywhere. Everywhere.


EXT. COOPER’S FARM - MORNING
An old man, handkerchief across his face, sweeps dust out of
the door onto the porch. This is Grandpa (DONALD).


INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - MORNING
Cooper pours himself coffee as Donald puts grits on the
table. TOM, Cooper’s fifteen-year-old son, stuffs his face.

Murph, wet hair, towel around neck, plays with pieces of a
MODEL (a lunar lander).
                    DONALD
          Not at the table, Murph.

                    MURPH
          Dad, can you fix this?
                    COOPER
               (takes pieces, frowning)
          What’d you do to my lander?
                       MURPH
          Wasn’t me.
                    TOM
          Lemme guess - your ghost?
                    MURPH
          It knocked it off my shelf. It
          keeps knocking books off.

                     TOM
          There’s no such things as ghosts,
          dumb-ass -
                                                       4.


                       COOPER
                  (to Tom)
          Hey -
                    MURPH
          I looked it up, it’s called a
          poltergeist.
                    TOM
          Dad, tell her.

                    COOPER
          Murph, you know that’s not
          scientific.
                    MURPH
          You say science is about admitting
          what we don’t know.
                    DONALD
          She’s got you there.
                    COOPER
               (hands her pieces)
          Start looking after our stuff.
Donald looks at Cooper, admonishing. Cooper shrugs.
                    COOPER
          Fine. Murph, you wanna talk
          science, don’t just tell me you’re
          scared of some ghost - record the
          facts, analyze, present your
          conclusions.

                       MURPH
          Sure.
Cooper gets up, grabs his keys.

                    DONALD
          Hold up.
               (Off look.)
          Parent-teacher conferences.
          ’Parent’ - not ’grandparent’.


EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
The kids pile into an old pickup truck, scraping DUST off
the seats. Cooper, coffee in hand, peers at a black cloud.
                                                        5.


                    COOPER
          Dust storm?
                    DONALD
               (shakes his head)
          Nelson’s torching his whole crop.

                    COOPER
          Blight?
                    DONALD
          They’re saying it’s the last
          harvest for okra. Ever.
Cooper stares at the smoke. Uneasy. Gets into the truck.
                    COOPER
          Shoulda planted corn like the rest
          of us.
                    DONALD
          Be nice to Miss Hanley. She’s
          single.

                    COOPER
          What’s that supposed to mean?
                    DONALD
          Repopulating the Earth - start
          pulling your weight.
                    COOPER
          Start minding your business.


INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DIRT ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper sips his coffee, steering while Murph shifts -
                    COOPER
          Okay, gimme second -

Murph wrestles the long gear stick into second. Cooper sips.
                    COOPER
          Now third -

Murph struggles to find third - GRIND.
                    TOM
          Find a gear, dumb-ass.
                                                       6.

                    MURPH
          Shut up, Tom!

BANG - A TIRE BLOWS OUT. Cooper stops the truck.
                    TOM
          What’d you do, Murph?
                    COOPER
          She didn’t do anything. We lost a
          tire is all.
                    TOM
          Murphy’s Law.

                    MURPH
          Shut up, Tom.
Cooper gets out of the truck, checks the flat, turns to Tom.
                    COOPER
          Grab the spare.
                    TOM
          That is the spare.
                    COOPER
          Okay, patch kit.
                    TOM
          How’m I supposed to patch it out
          here?

                    COOPER
          Figure it out. I’m not always going
          to be here to help you.
Tom moves to the back of the truck. Murph is there.

                    MURPH
          Why’d you and Mom name me after
          something bad?
                       COOPER
          We didn’t.
                    MURPH
          Murphy’s Law?
                    COOPER
          Murphy’s Law doesn’t mean bad stuff
          will happen. It means ’whatever can
          happen, will happen’. And that
          sounded just fine to us.
                                                          7.

Murph frowns, hearing something ...
                     COOPER
          What?
Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLE. Cooper GRABS Murph
as a DRONE SOARS low overhead -
                     COOPER
          Come on!
Cooper jumps into the truck - he pulls out a laptop and
antenna hands them to Murph - shouts at Tom -
                     COOPER
          Get in!
                    TOM
               (jack in hand)
          What about the tire?


INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK THROUGH FIELDS - MOMENTS LATER
Close on the SHREDDING TIRE as the truck BARRELS through
cornfields. Murph fires up the laptop. Cooper strains to see
through the cornstalks, scanning the horizon -

                     TOM
          There!
To the right, the dark shape of the drone, cruising low over
the fields. Cooper JERKS the wheel - the drone has long,
thin wings like a U-2, but no cockpit.
                    COOPER
          Indian air force surveillance
          drone. Solar cells could power an
          entire farm.
               (To Tom.)
          Take the wheel -
Tom takes the wheel - Cooper hands Murph the antenna.

                    COOPER
          Keep it pointed right at it -
Cooper works the laptop - the screen fills with Hindi.
          Faster, Tom. I’m losing it.

Tom WEAVES through the corn - they round a corner, almost
HIT a HARVESTER - BANG - the truck loses a wing mirror -
Ahead the drone SOARS, banking, pulling away -
                                                        8.


The truck BURSTS out of the corn, Cooper’s nose is in the
laptop.
                    TOM
          Dad?

                    COOPER
          Almost got it. Don’t stop.
In front of them, the drone plummets from view into the next
valley - the path ahead leads to a three-hundred-foot drop.

                    TOM
          DAD ...
Cooper looks up.

                    COOPER
          Tom!
Tom locks up the brakes. Cooper looks at him - he shrugs.
                    TOM
          You told me to keep going.
Cooper grabs the laptop and opens the door.
                    COOPER
          Guess that answers the ’if I told
          you to drive off a cliff’ scenario.
Murph is still pointing the antenna.
                    MURPH
          We lost it.

                    COOPER
               (smiles)
          No, we didn’t.

The DRONE SOARS BACK OVER THEM - Cooper is moving his
fingers across the track pad, PILOTING THE DRONE.
As the kids watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring over them,
banking above the valley. Cooper crouches next to Murph.

                    COOPER
          Want to give it a whirl?
Murph, guided by Cooper, moves her fingers across the track
pad - the massive drone BANKS in response. Murph is in
heaven.
                                                       9.


                    COOPER
          Let’s set her down next to the
          river.


EXT. RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER
The truck limps up to the drone. Cooper and the kids climb
down. Cooper runs a hand along the smooth carbon flank of
the aircraft.

                    TOM
          How long you think it’s been up
          there?
                    COOPER
          Delhi mission control went down
          same as ours, ten years ago.
                    TOM
          It’s been up there ten years? Why’d
          it come down so low?

                    COOPER
          Sun finally cooked its brain. Or it
          came down looking for something.
                    MURPH
          What?

                    COOPER
          Some kind of signal. Who knows?
Cooper finds an access hatch. Pries it open. Examines the
black-box brain of the machine.
                    MURPH
          What are you going to do with it?
                    COOPER
          Give it something socially
          responsible to do, like drive a
          combine.
                    MURPH
          Couldn’t we just let it go? It’s
          not hurting anyone.
Cooper looks down at his daughter. Good kid.
                    COOPER
          This thing has to adapt, just like
          the rest of us.
                                                        10.


EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL - DAY
The truck pulls up to school, drone fuselage hanging out.
                    COOPER
          How’s this work? You guys come
          with?
                    TOM
          I’ve got class. But she ...

Pats Murph on shoulder.
          Needs to wait.
Murph glares at Tom as he hops out.
                       COOPER
          Why? What?
                    MURPH
          Dad, I had a thing ... well,
          they’ll tell you about it. Just try
          and ...

                    COOPER
          Am I gonna be mad?
                    MURPH
          Not with me. Just try not to -

                    COOPER
          Relax, I got this.
Murph pulls out a notebook. Starts drawing a BARCODE.


INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - LATER (MORNING)
Cooper enters, awkward. The PRINCIPAL (male, fifties) turns
from the window.

                    PRINCIPAL
          Little late, Coop.
               (Indicates chair.)
          Guess you had to stop off at the
          Asian fighter plane store.

                    COOPER
               (sits, smiles)
          Actually, sir, it’s a surveillance
          drone. With outstanding solar
          cells.
                                                       11.


Cooper nods at Murph’s teacher, Ms Hanley, thirties,
attractive.
                    PRINCIPAL
          We got Tom’s scores back. He’s
          going to make an excellent farmer.
          Congratulations.
The Principal slides a paper across the desk.
                    COOPER
               (taken aback)
          What about college?
                    PRINCIPAL
          The university only takes a
          handful. They don’t have resources
          -
                    COOPER
          I’m still paying taxes - where’s
          that go? There’s no more armies.

                    PRINCIPAL
          Not to the university. Coop, you
          have to be realistic.
                    COOPER
          You’re ruling him out for college
          now? He’s fifteen.
                    PRINCIPAL
          Tom’s score simply isn’t high
          enough.

                    COOPER
          What’re you? About a
          thirty-six-inch waist?
               (Beat.)
          Thirty-inch inseam?

                    PRINCIPAL
          I’m not sure I see what -
                    COOPER
          You’re telling me you need two
          numbers to measure your own ass,
          but just one to measure my son’s
          future?
Ms Hanley stifles a laugh. The Principal shoots her a look.
                                                     12.


                    PRINCIPAL
          You’re a well educated man, Coop. A
          trained pilot -
                    COOPER
          And an engineer.
                    PRINCIPAL
          Okay. Well, right now the world
          doesn’t need more engineers. We
          didn’t run out of planes, or
          television sets. We ran out of
          food.
Cooper leans back. He’s not going to win this one.
                    PRINCIPAL
          The world needs farmers. Good
          farmers, like you. And Tom.
               (Smiles benignly.)
          We’re a caretaker generation. And
          things are getting better. Maybe
          your grandchildren -

                    COOPER
          Are we done, sir?
                    PRINCIPAL
          No. Ms Hanley is here to talk about
          Murph.
Cooper shifts his gaze to Ms Hanley.
                    MS HANLEY
          Murph’s a bright kid. A wonderful
          kid, Mr Cooper. But she’s been
          having a little trouble ...
Ms Hanley places a textbook on the desk.
          She brought this to school, to show
          the other kids the section on the
          lunar landings ...
                    COOPER
          Yeah, it’s one of my old textbooks,
          she likes the pictures.

                    MS HANLEY
          This is an old federal textbook.
          We’ve replaced them with corrected
          versions.
                                                        13.


                       COOPER
          Corrected?
                    MS HANLEY
          Explaining how the Apollo missions
          were faked to bankrupt the Soviet
          Union.
                    COOPER
          You don’t believe we went to the
          moon?

                    MS HANLEY
               (tolerant smile)
          I believe it was a brilliant piece
          of propaganda. The Soviets
          bankrupted themselves pouring
          resources into rockets and other
          useless machines.
                    COOPER
          ’Useless machines’?

                    MS HANLEY
          Yes, Mr Cooper. And if we don’t
          want a repeat of the wastefulness
          and excess of the twentieth
          century, our children need to learn
          about this planet, not tales of
          leaving it.
Cooper considers this in silence. Looks at Ms Hanley.
                    COOPER
          One of those useless machines they
          used to make was called an MRI. And
          if we had any of them left, the
          doctors might have been able to
          find the cyst in my wife’s brain
          before she died, rather than
          afterwards. Then she could be
          sitting here listening to this,
          which’d be good, cos she was always
          the calmer one ...
Ms Hanley looks at Cooper, embarrassed. Then -

                    MS HANLEY
          I’m sorry about your wife, Mr
          Cooper. But Murph got into a fist
          fight with several of her
          classmates over this Apollo
          nonsense and we thought it best to

                    MS HANLEY (cont’d)
          bring you in and see what ideas you
          might have for dealing with her
          behavior on the home front.

                    COOPER
          Sure. Well, there’s a ball game
          tomorrow night, and Murph’s going
          through a bit of a baseball phase.
          There’ll be candy and soda ...

Ms Hanley looks at him, expectant.
                    COOPER
          I think I’ll take her to that.
Ms Hanley turns to the Principal, not happy.


EXT. PICKUP TRUCK OUTSIDE SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER
Murph looks up from her notebook at her dad, expectantly.

                    MURPH
          How’d it go?
                    COOPER
          I, uh ... got you suspended.

                    MURPH
          What?!
                    COOPER
          Sorry.

                    MURPH
          Dad! I told you not to -
The CB radio CRACKLES to life.

                    CB OPERATOR
          Cooper? Boots for Cooper.
                    COOPER
          Cooper.

                    BOOTS
               (over radio)
          Coop, those combines you rebuilt
          went haywire.
                                                         15.


                    COOPER
          Power the controllers down for a
          couple minutes.
                    BOOTS
               (over radio)
          Did that. You should come take a
          look, it’s kinda weird.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Cooper and Murph pass a slow-moving harvester pulling up to
the house, which is surrounded by AUTOMATED FARM MACHINES.
They’ve nosed up to the house like animals at a Nativity.
Boots, the farm hand, approaches -

                    BOOTS
          One by one they been peeling off
          from the fields and heading over.
Cooper pops open the cabin to a harvester. Checks the auto
pilot hooked up to the controls.

                    BOOTS
          Something’s interfering with their
          compass ...
Cooper jumps down and heads to the front door. Enters.

                    BOOTS (O.S.)
          Magnetism or some such ...


INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks at the kitchen. Nothing. Murph comes in.
                    MURPH
          What is it, Dad?

A small BANG from upstairs. Cooper heads up.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Murph’s bedroom clearly used to be her mother’s. Cooper, in
the doorway, looks at the wall of BOOKS opposite - several
GAPS. He looks down at some books on the floor.
                    MURPH
          Nothing special about which books.

                    MURPH (cont’d)
          Been working on it, like you said.
Murph holds up her notebook with its barcode.
                    MURPH
          I counted the spaces.
                      COOPER
          Why?

                    MURPH
          In case the ghost’s trying to say
          something. I’m trying Morse.
                      COOPER
          Morse?

                    MURPH
          Yeah. Dots and dashes, used for -
                    COOPER
          Murph, I know what Morse code is. I
          just don’t think your bookshelf’s
          trying to talk to you.
He leaves. Murph, embarrassed, turns back to the shelf.


INT. FRONT PORCH, FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Donald hands Cooper a beer.
                    COOPER
          Had to reset every compass clock
          and GPS to offset for the anomaly.
                      DONALD
          Which is?

                    COOPER
          No idea. If the house was built on
          magnetic ore, we’d’ve seen this the
          first time we switched on a
          tractor.

Donald nods. Sips.
                    DONALD
          Sounds like your meeting at school
          didn’t go so well.
                                                       17.


                    COOPER
               (sighs)
          We’ve forgotten who we are, Donald.
          Explorers, pioneers. Not
          caretakers.

Donald nods, thoughtful. Weighs up his words.
                    DONALD
          When I was a kid it felt like they
          made something new every day. Some
          gadget or idea. Like every day was
          Christmas. But six billion people
          ... just try to imagine that. And
          every last one of them trying to
          have it all.

He turns to Cooper.
          This world isn’t so bad. And Tom’ll
          do just fine - you’re the one who
          doesn’t belong. Born forty years
          too late, or forty years too early.
          My daughter knew it, God bless her.
          And your kids know it. ’Specially
          Murph.
                    COOPER
          We used to look up and wonder at
          our place in the stars. Now we just
          look down and worry about our place
          in the dirt.
                    DONALD
          Cooper, you were good at something
          and you never got a chance to do
          anything with it. I’m sorry. But
          that’s not your kids’ fault.
Cooper looks up at the stars above.

                    OLD-TIMER (V.O.)
          May 14th. Never forget. Clear as a
          bell. You’d never think ...

          end of the world.

EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON
The CRACK of ball off bat - a pop-fly caught to a trickle of
applause. Half-filled stands at what looks like a minor
league game.

                    DONALD
          In my day we had real ball players.
          Who’re these bums?
As the team runs in from the field we see: NEW YORK YANKEES.

                    COOPER
          Well, in my day people were too
          busy fighting over food for
          baseball, so consider this
          progress.

Murph offers Donald some popcorn.
                    DONALD
          Fine. But popcorn at a ball game is
          unnatural. I want a hot dog.

                    MURPH
               (confused)
          What’s a hot dog?
Cooper sits with Tom a row in front.

                    COOPER
          The school says you’re gonna follow
          in my footsteps. I think that’s
          great.

                    TOM
          You think that’s great?
                    MURPH
          You hate farming, Dad. Grandpa
          said.

Cooper looks at Donald, who shrugs ’sorry’.
                    COOPER
          What’s important is how you feel
          about it, Tom.
                    TOM
          I like what you do. I like our
          farm.
                                                      19.


On the field: the batter hits one along the ground - it
rolls to an infielder’s foot - but the infielder IGNORES it,
STARING up at the sky. The crowd starts to look up ...
                    OLD-TIMER (V.O.)
          You’ve never seen the like. Black.
          Just black ...
INSERT CUT: THE OLD-TIMER CHOKES BACK FEAR AS HE REMEMBERS.
Cooper stares at the horizon, where an ENORMOUS BLACK DUST
STORM IS MASSING. People start leaving, tying handkerchiefs
across their faces.
                    COOPER
          Come on, guys.


INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper speeds along as Donald and the kids stuff RAGS into
cracks and vents ... behind them the WALL OF BLACK DUST
ADVANCES, SWALLOWING UP ROADS, BUILDINGS. A nasty SOUND is
developing - the truck ROCKING with GUSTS of wind ...
Suddenly, BLACK DUST ENVELOPS the car, LIGHTNING CRACKLING.
                    DONALD
          It’s a bad one ...

                    COOPER
          Mask up, guys.
Murph and Tom take SURGICAL MASKS out of the glove box.


EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
VISIBILITY MERE FEET as the dust storm BRUTALIZES the farm.
The truck CRAWLS up to the house. Cooper leans in to try and
see better ... CRACK - a panel of sheet metal SMASHES into
the windshield - Cooper turns - wrestles Murph out of the
truck as Donald blindly stumbles towards the front door with
Tom ...


INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The SHUTTERS BANG as the wind WHIPS around the house,
FORCING JETS OF DUST up through cracks in the window frames,
floorboards ... Donald SLAMS the door. Murph is COUGHING ...
Cooper looks around. Sees dust coming from upstairs.

                    COOPER
          Did you both shut your windows?
Tom nods. Murph looks at Cooper. Runs for the stairs.
                       COOPER
          Wait -

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cooper gets to the doorway. Murph stands in the middle of
the room, STARING. Cooper SHUTS the window. The dust hangs
in the relative quiet. Murph is staring, TRANSFIXED, at
LINES where dust is FALLING UNNATURALLY FAST, STREAMING DOWN
through the air, collecting on the floor in a PATTERN -

                       MURPH
          The Ghost.
Cooper STARES at dust collecting like snow on power lines...
                    COOPER
          Grab your pillow, sleep in with
          Tom.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN - MORNING

Calm. Dust settled.

INT. TOM’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Murph slips out of bed, wrapped in her blanket. Pads down
the hall, peeks in her bedroom door at -

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cooper sits, staring at the PATTERN of dust: thick radial
lines, like a CIRCULAR BARCODE. Murph sits down next to her
dad. They STARE at it together. He holds up a coin ...
                    COOPER
          It’s not a ghost ...

Cooper tosses the coin across a line. It SHOOTS at the floor
-
          It’s gravity.
                                                      21.


INT. SAME - LATER
Donald pokes his head in.
                    DONALD
          I’m dropping Tom, then heading to
          town ...
               (Looks at dust pattern.)
          You wanna clean that up when you’ve
          finished praying to it?

Cooper reaches for Murph’s notebook. Starts writing ...

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - LATER
Murph fills a glass of water. Picks up a plate of
sandwiches.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Follow Murph into the room, to find Cooper standing there.

                    COOPER
          I got something.
Cooper is pointing to the thick and thin radial lines -
          Binary. Thick is one, thin is zero
          - it’s numbers ... number pairs...
He holds up the notebook to show Murph the number pairs.
          Coordinates.


INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper and Murph pore over MAPS. Cooper TOSSES one aside,
lays it out on the table. Finds a spot. Looks up at Murph
...


EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper packing his truck - sleeping bag, flashlight ...
                    MURPH
          You can’t leave me behind!
                    COOPER
          Grandpa’s back in two hours.

           find -
                     COOPER
           That’s why I can’t take you.

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper grabs the maps and a bottle of water. He calls up -

                     COOPER
           Murph?
Nothing.
           Murph, just wait here for Grandpa.
           Tell him I’ll call him on the
           radio.

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper drives, map spread on the wheel, looks for a pen -
reaches over to the passenger wheel well - lifts a BLANKET -
Murph is there -
                     COOPER
           JESUS!

The truck WOBBLES as Cooper regains control.
          Murph, what are you doing?!
Murph is LAUGHING as she climbs into the passenger seat -

                     COOPER
           It’s not funny -
But Murph’s laugh is infectious.

                     MURPH
           You wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t
           for me.
Cooper hands Murph the map.

                     COOPER
           Fair enough. Make yourself
           useful...
The pickup cruises down the road, heading for the MOUNTAINS.

EXT. PLAINS APPROACHING MOUNTAINS - DUSK
The tiny pickup is dwarfed by the darkening foothills.

EXT. DIRT ROAD OFF MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT

Cooper pulls up to a gate in chain-link fence. Murph is
asleep next to him.
                    COOPER
          Murph. Murph.
Murph wakes.
          I think this is as far as we get.
Murph glances out at the fence. Closes her eyes again.

                    MURPH
          Why? You didn’t bring the
          bolt-cutters?
                    COOPER
          I like your spirit, young lady.
Cooper gets out of the truck, retrieves his bolt-cutters and
comes up to the fence. He looks up and down the road.
Nothing. He reaches out and puts the jaws of the cutters -

WHAM! SPOTLIGHTS IN COOPER’S EYES - A HARSH ELECTRIC VOICE -
                    VOICE
          STEP AWAY FROM THE FENCE.
Cooper drops the cutters, puts his hands in the air -

                    COOPER
          Don’t shoot! My child is in the
          car! I’m unarmed! My daughter is -
Murph watches, terrified as, with a ZAP, Cooper DROPS. Murph
SCRAMBLES back along the seat as MASSIVE FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.
The door is WRENCHED open - a BLINDING LIGHT
                    VOICE
          DON’T BE AFRAID.

Murph SCREAMS.
                                                      24.


INT. BRIGHT, INDUSTRIAL ROOM - LATER
Cooper comes to, sitting in a chair. Opposite him is an
ARTICULATED MACHINE. A VOICE emanates from its side.
                    MACHINE
          How did you find this place?
                    COOPER
          Where’s my daughter?

                    MACHINE
          You had the coordinates for this
          facility marked on your map. Where
          did you get them?
Cooper leans in to the machine.

                    COOPER
          WHERE’S MY DAUGHTER?!
Cooper’s scream REVERBERATES. Cooper sizes up the machine.
          You might think you’re still in the
          Marines, but the Marines don’t
          exist anymore, pal. I’ve got grunts
          like you mowing my grass ...
The Machine RISES to its full height.

                    MACHINE
          How did you find us?
                    COOPER
          But you don’t look like a lawnmower
          to me ... you, I’m gonna turn into
          an overqualified vacuum cleaner -
                    FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          No, you’re not.

Cooper turns to see a businesslike woman in her thirties.
                    WOMAN
          Tars, back down, please.
The machine, TARS, sinks back down.

                    COOPER
          You’re taking a risk using
          ex-military for security. They’re
          old, their control units are
          unpredictable ...
                                                      25.


                    WOMAN
          Well, that’s what the government
          could spare.
                    COOPER
          Who are you?
                      WOMAN
          Dr Brand.
                    COOPER
          I knew a Dr Brand once. But he was
          a professor -
                    WOMAN (BRAND)
          What makes you think I’m not?

                    COOPER
          And nowhere near as cute.
                    BRAND
          You think you can flirt your way
          out of this mess?

                    COOPER
               (honest, scared)
          Dr Brand, I have no idea what this
          mess is. I’m scared for my little
          girl and I want her by my side.
          Then I’ll tell you anything you
          want to know. Okay?
Brand considers this. Turns to Tars.
                    BRAND
          Get the principals and the girl
          into the conference room.
               (To Cooper.)
          Your daughter’s fine. Bright kid.
               (Rises.)
          Must have a very smart mother.

INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper follows Brand into a corridor. Tars LURCHES behind.

                    COOPER
          It’s pretty clear you don’t want
          visitors - why not let us back up
          from your fence and be on our way?
                                                       26.


                    BRAND
          It’s not that simple.
                    COOPER
          Sure it is. I don’t know anything
          about you or this place.

                    BRAND
          Yes, you do.
Brand ushers Cooper through a door into a conference room -


INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Where an OLD MAN is crouched down, talking to Murph.

                    MURPH
          Dad!
Murph runs into Cooper’s arms. The Old Man SMILES at Cooper.
                    OLD MAN
          Hello, Cooper.
                    COOPER
               (stunned)
          Professor Brand?

                    MAN AT TABLE (DOYLE)
          Just take a seat, Mr Cooper.
Cooper and Murph sit at a table where five people are
waiting - a bespectacled man, WILLIAMS, leans forward to
address Cooper.

                    WILLIAMS
          Explain how you found this
          facility.
                    COOPER
          Stumbled across it. Looking for
          salvage and I saw the fence -
                    WILLIAMS
          You’re sitting in the world’s best
          kept secret - you don’t stumble in.
          And you certainly don’t stumble
          out.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Cooper, please. Cooperate with
          these people.
                                                        27.


Cooper looks nervously around the room.
                    COOPER
          It’s hard to explain, but we
          learned these coordinates from an
          anomaly ...

                    DOYLE
          What sort of anomaly?
                    COOPER
          I don’t want to term it
          ’supernatural’ ... but ...
Cooper is losing them. Williams leans forward. Serious.
                    WILLIAMS
          You’re going to have to, Mr Cooper.
          Real quick.
                    COOPER
          After that last storm, it was a
          pattern ... in dust ...

                    MURPH
          It was gravity.
All eyes turn to Murph. She’s said the magic word. Doyle
looks at Professor Brand, excited. Turns to Cooper -

                    DOYLE
          Where was this gravitational
          anomaly?
                    COOPER
          Look, I’m happy you’re excited
          about gravity, but if you want more
          answers from us I’m gonna need
          assurances -

                    WILLIAMS
          Assurances?
Cooper looks at Murph. Then covers Murph’s ears.
                    COOPER
          That we’re getting out of here ...
          and not in the trunk of some car.
Brand laughs. Williams smiles. Cooper looks confused.
                                                       28.


                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Don’t you know who we are, Coop?
                    COOPER
          No. No, I don’t.

                    BRAND
               (points around table)
          Williams, Doyle, Jenkins, Smith,
          you already know my father,
          Professor Brand. We’re NASA.

                    COOPER
          NASA?
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          NASA. Same NASA you flew for.

Now Cooper is laughing, too. Murph looks around, confused.

INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER

Professor Brand shows Cooper the facility.
                    COOPER
          I heard you got shut down for
          refusing to drop bombs from the
          stratosphere onto starving people.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          When they realized killing other
          people wasn’t a long term solution
          they needed us back. Set us up in
          the old NORAD facility. In secret.

                    COOPER
          Why secret?
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Public opinion won’t allow spending
          on space exploration. Not when
          we’re struggling to put food on the
          table.
Professor Brand ushers Cooper through a large door -
                                                      29.


INT. GREENHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Professor Brand gestures to large PLANTATIONS under glass.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Blight. Wheat seven years ago, okra
          this year. Now there’s just corn.
                    COOPER
          But we’re growing more than ever -

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Like the potatoes in Ireland, like
          the wheat in the dust bowl, the
          corn will die. Soon.
Brand enters with Murph. She shows her the greenhouses.

                    COOPER
          We’ll find a way, we always have.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Driven by the unshakable faith that
          the Earth is ours.
                    COOPER
          Not just ours, but it is our home.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Earth’s atmosphere is 80 percent
          nitrogen. We don’t even breathe
          nitrogen.
Professor Brand shows him a blighted stalk.
          Blight does. And as it thrives our
          air contains less and less oxygen
          ...
Professor Brand gestures over at Murph ...
          The last people to starve will be
          the first to suffocate. Your
          daughter’s generation will be the
          last to survive on Earth.
Cooper looks over at Murph. Then back to Professor Brand.

                    COOPER
          Tell me this is where you explain
          how you’re going to save the world.
                                                      30.


INT. VAST CIRCULAR CHAMBER (LAUNCH FACILITY) - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper and Professor Brand enter like ants in a grain silo.
A ROCKET is on a pad, DWARFED by the circular chamber. Far
above, a ring of mirrors reflects the dawn down into the
facility.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          We’re not meant to save the world
          ... we’re meant to leave it.

Cooper stares up at the rocket. He recognizes the
arrangement of two CRAFT at the top.
                     COOPER
          Rangers.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          The last components of our one
          versatile ship in orbit, the
          Endurance. Our final expedition.
                    COOPER
          What happened to the other
          vehicles?
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          The Lazarus missions.

                    COOPER
          Sounds cheerful.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Lazarus came back from the dead -

                    COOPER
          He had to die in the first place.
          You sent people out there looking
          for a new home ...

Professor Brand nods.
          There’s no planet in our solar
          system that can support life ...
          and it’d take them a thousand years
          to reach the nearest star - that
          doesn’t even qualify as futile ...
          Where did you send them, Professor?
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Cooper, I can’t tell you any more
          unless you agree to pilot this
          craft. You’re the best we ever had.
                                                      31.

                    COOPER
          I barely left the stratosphere.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          This crew’s never left the
          simulator. We can’t program this
          mission from Earth, we don’t know
          what’s out there. We need a pilot.
          And this is the mission you were
          trained for.
                    COOPER
          Without ever knowing. An hour ago,
          you didn’t even know I was still
          alive. And you were going anyway.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          We had no choice. But something
          brought you here. They chose you.
                    COOPER
          Who’s ’they’?
Professor Brand is silent. Cooper wrestles.
          How long would I be gone?
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Hard to know. Years.
                    COOPER
          I’ve got my kids, Professor.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Get out there and save them.
Cooper considers this. Decides.
                    COOPER
          Who’s ’they’?

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
A man in his forties has the solar system up on the screen.
This is ROMILLY.
                    ROMILLY
          We started detecting gravitational
          anomalies almost fifty years ago.
          Mostly small distortions to our
          instruments in the upper atmosphere
          - I believe you encountered one
          yourself ...
                                                      32.


                    COOPER
               (realizing)
          Over the Straights - my crash -
          something tripped my fly-by wire -

                    ROMILLY
          Exactly. But the most significant
          anomaly was this ...
Cooper stares at an image of Saturn and its moons. Romilly
zooms in on some stars DISTORTED like ripples in a pond.

                    ROMILLY
          A disturbance of spacetime out near
          Saturn.
                    COOPER
          A wormhole?
                    ROMILLY
          It appeared forty-eight years ago.
                    COOPER
          Where does it lead?
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Another galaxy.
                    COOPER
          A wormhole isn’t a naturally
          occurring phenomenon.
                    BRAND
          Someone placed it there.

                    COOPER
          ’They’.
                     BRAND
          And whoever ’They’ are, they appear
          to be looking out for us - that
          wormhole lets us travel to other
          stars. It came along right as we
          needed it.
                    DOYLE
          They’ve put potentially habitable
          worlds within our reach. Twelve, in
          fact from our initial probes.
                    COOPER
          You sent probes into it?
                                                      33.


                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          We sent people into it. Ten years
          ago.
                    COOPER
          The Lazarus missions.
Professor Brand rises and moves to a MEMORIAL, pointing -
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Twelve possible worlds. Twelve
          Ranger launches carrying the
          bravest humans ever to live, led by
          the remarkable Dr Mann.
                    DOYLE
          Each person’s landing pod had life
          support for two years - but they
          could use hibernation to stretch
          that, making observations on
          organics over a decade or more.
          Their mission was to assess their
          world, and if it showed promise,
          send a signal, bed down for the
          long nap, and wait to be rescued.
                    COOPER
          And if their world didn’t show
          promise?

                    DOYLE
          Hence the bravery.
                    COOPER
          Because you don’t have resources to
          visit all twelve.
                    DOYLE
          No. Data transmission back through
          the wormhole is rudimentary, simple
          binary ’pings’ on an annual basis
          to give some clue as to which
          worlds have potential. One system
          shows promise.
                    COOPER
          One? Kind of a long shot.
                    BRAND
          One system with three potential
          worlds ... no long shot.
                                                      34.


                    COOPER
          So if we find a new home, what
          then?
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          That’s the long shot. There’s Plan
          A and there’s Plan B. Did you
          notice anything strange about the
          launch chamber ...


INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper cocks his head, puzzling at the VAST chamber ...
there are structures built SIDEWAYS around the CURVED
walls...

                    COOPER
          This whole facility ... it’s a
          vehicle? A space station?
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Both. We’ve been working on it, and
          others like it for twenty-five
          years. Plan A.
                    COOPER
          How does it get off the Earth?

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Those first gravitational anomalies
          changed everything - suddenly we
          knew that harnessing gravity was
          real. So I started working on the
          theory - and we start building this
          station.
                    COOPER
          But you haven’t solved it, yet.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          That’s why there’s a Plan B.

INT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

TECHNICIANS work the complex, high-tech lab. Professor Brand
and Cooper follow Brand to a large glass and steel
apparatus.
                    BRAND
          The problem is gravity. How to get
          a viable amount of human life off
                    (MORE)
                                                         35.


                    BRAND (cont’d)
          this planet. This is one way - Plan
          B. A population bomb. Almost five
          thousand fertilized eggs, weighing
          in at under 900 kilos.
                    COOPER
          How could you raise them?
                    BRAND
          With equipment on board we incubate
          the first ten. After that, with
          surrogacy, the growth becomes
          exponential - within thirty years
          we might have a colony of hundreds.
          The real difficulty of colonization
          is genetic diversity,
               (Indicates vials.)
          This takes care of that.
Cooper looks at the equipment. Unenthusiastic.
                    COOPER
          We just give up on the people here?

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          That’s why Plan A’s a lot more fun.

INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE

Professor Brand watches Cooper as he gazes over the vast
tracts of ALGEBRA covering every available surface.
                    COOPER
          Where have you got to?

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Almost there.
                    COOPER
          Almost? You’re asking me to hang
          everything on an ’almost’?
Professor Brand moves close to Cooper.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          I’m asking you to trust me.

Cooper looks at the passion in Professor Brand’s eyes.
                                                      36.

                    COOPER
          All those years of training - you
          never told me.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          We can’t always be open about
          everything, Coop, even if we want
          to be. What can you tell your
          children about this mission?

Cooper considers this. Uneasy.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Find us a new home. When you
          return, I’ll have solved the
          problem of gravity. You have my
          word.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE DAY

Donald, on the porch, gets to his feet as he sees Cooper’s
pickup approaching. The truck pulls up. Murph TEARS past
Grandpa into the house - Donald looks at Cooper,
questioning.


INT. HALL OUTSIDE MURPH’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cooper tries to open the door, but Murph has stacked a desk
and chair against it -
                       COOPER
          Murph?
                    MURPH
          Go! If you’re leaving, just go!


EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
Donald looks out at the night, taking it all in.
                    DONALD
          This world never was enough for
          you, was it, Coop?
                       COOPER
          I’m not    gonna lie to you, Donald -
          heading    out there is what I feel
          born to    do and it excites me. That
          doesn’t    make it wrong.
Donald considers this. Turns to Cooper.
                                                       37.


                     DONALD
           It might. Don’t trust the right
           thing done for the wrong reason.
           The ’why’ of a thing? That’s the
           foundation.

                     COOPER
                (sadly)
           Well, the foundation’s solid.
                (Gestures at landscape.)
           We farmers sit here every year when
           the rains fail and say ’next year’.
           Next year ain’t gonna save us. Nor
           the one after. This world’s a
           treasure, Donald. But she’s been
           telling us to leave for a while
           now.
                (Stares at the horizon.)
           Mankind was born on Earth. It was
           never meant to die here.
Donald considers this. Scoops the dust off the rail.

                     DONALD
           Tom’ll be okay. But you have to
           make it right with Murph.
                     COOPER
           I will.
                     DONALD
           Without making any promises you
           don’t know you can keep.

Cooper meets Donald’s gaze. Looks away, nodding.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Cooper’s hand, reaching in, removes the chair from the desk,
barricading the door. Murph is lying on the bed, turned
away. Cooper pushes the desk back gently. Enters, quietly.
                     COOPER
           You have to talk to me.

Nothing.
           I have to fix this before I go.
Murph turns, tear-stained, angry cheeks blazing -
                                                      38.

                    MURPH
          Then I’ll keep it broken so you
          have to stay.

Cooper sits down on the bed next to Murph.
                    COOPER
          After you kids came along, your
          mother said something I didn’t
          really understand - she said, ’I
          look at the babies and I see myself
          as they’ll remember me.’ She said,
          ’It’s as if we don’t exist anymore,
          like we’re ghosts, like now we’re
          just there to be memories for our
          kids.’ Now I realize - once we’re
          parents, we’re just the ghosts of
          our childrens’ futures.
                    MURPH
          You said ghosts don’t exist.

                    COOPER
          That’s right. I can’t be your ghost
          right now - I need to exist.
          Because they chose me. They chose
          me, Murph. You saw it. Murph sits
          up.
Points at the shelves. The gaps.
                    MURPH
          I figured out the message ...
               (Opens her notebook.)
          It was Morse code ...
                       COOPER
          Murph -

                    MURPH
          One word. You know what it is?
Cooper shakes his head sadly. Murph holds out her notebook -
          ’STAY’. It says ’STAY’, Dad.

                       COOPER
          Oh, Murph.
                    MURPH
          You don’t believe me?! Look the
          books! Look at -
Cooper takes his daughter in his arms ...
                                                         39.

                    COOPER
          It’s okay, it’s okay ...

Murph buries her head on Cooper’s shoulder, sobbing.
          Murph, a father looks in his
          child’s eyes and thinks - maybe
          it’s them ... maybe my child will
          save the world. And everyone, once
          a child, wants to look into their
          own dad’s eyes and know he saw how
          they saved some little corner of
          their world. But, usually, by then,
          the father is gone.
                    MURPH
          Like you will be.
Cooper looks at his daughter. Lies with head, not heart:
                    COOPER
          No. I’m coming back.

                    MURPH
          When?
Cooper reaches into his pocket. Pulls out two WATCHES.

                    COOPER
          One for you. One for me.
Murph takes the watch, curious. Cooper holds up his watch.
          When I’m in hyper-sleep, or travel
          near the speed of light, or near a
          black hole, time will change for
          me. It’ll run more slowly. When I
          get back we’ll compare.
                    MURPH
          Time will run differently for us?
                    COOPER
          Yup. By the time I get back we
          might even be the same age. You and
          me. Imagine that ...

Murph takes this in. Cooper sees he’s made a mistake.
          Wait, Murph -
                    MURPH
          You have no idea when you’re coming
          back.
Cooper looks at his daughter.
                                                       40.


                     MURPH
           No idea at all!
Murph THROWS the watch - TURNS HER BACK.
                     COOPER
           Don’t make me leave like this.
Nothing.
           Please. I have to go now.

Murph will not turn around. Cooper tries to rest his hand on
the back of her head, but she shakes it off.
                     COOPER
           I love you, Murph. Forever. And I’m
           coming back.

Cooper walks slowly out. A BOOK DROPS FROM THE SHELF. Cooper
turns to look at it. Then leaves.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper, mechanical, puts his small bag in the truck.
                     DONALD
           How’d it go?

                     COOPER
           Fine. It was fine.
Cooper turns to Tom. Hugs him. Tight enough for both kids.
          I love you, Tom.

                     TOM
           Travel safe, Dad.
                     COOPER
                (indicates farm)
           Look after our place, you hear?

                     TOM
           Can I use your truck while you’re
           gone?

                     COOPER
                (smiles)
           I’ll make sure they bring it back
           for you.
Cooper gets in. Starts the engine.
          Mind my kids for me, Donald.
                                                         41.


Donald nods. Cooper pulls out.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Murph jumps off the bed, GRABS the watch, RUNS downstairs.


INT. PICKUP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
As Cooper drives he lifts the blanket in the wheel-well
where Murph hid last time. Nothing. And we hear a
COUNTDOWN...
                    VOICE
               (O.S.)
          TEN ... NINE ...


EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Murph RACES out of the house, watch in hand -

                    MURPH
          Dad?! DAD?!
                    VOICE
               (V.O.)
          EIGHT ... SEVEN ...

But Cooper is a dust trail far down the road.
                    VOICE
               (O.S.)
          SIX ... FIVE ...

Murph SOBS as her grandpa puts his arms around her ...

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DUSTY PLAIN - CONTINUOUS

As Cooper drives away tears roll down his cheeks
                    VOICE
               (O.S.)
          FOUR ... THREE ... TWO ... ONE ...

INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - DAY
                    VOICE
               (O.S.)
          IGNITION.

FIRE SHOOTS FROM THE BASE OF THE ROCKET ... The rocket RISES
slowly from the pad, up into the sky ...

INT. RANGER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Cooper, in his space helmet, lets the FORCE of the rocket
vibrate through him ...
                    VOICE
               (O.S.)
          Stage one ... SEPARATION.
Cooper starts to see the Earth’s curve through the window...
                    VOICE
               (O.S.)
          Stage two ... SEPARATION.
And Cooper shakes loose the bonds of Earth.

EXT. UPPER ATMOSPHERE - CONTINUOUS

The rocket RIPS upwards into the sky.
INT. RANGER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper glances around the vibrating, cramped cockpit -
Brand, Doyle, Romilly, Tars. Tars spots Cooper’s glance -
                    TARS
          All here, Mr Cooper. Plenty of
          slaves for my robot colony.

Cooper looks at him, confused.
                    DOYLE
          They gave him a humor setting so
          he’d fit in with his unit better.
          He thinks it relaxes us.
                    COOPER
          A massive, sarcastic robot. What a
          great idea.
                                                         43.


                    TARS
          I have a cue light I can turn on
          when I’m joking, if you like.
                    COOPER
          Probably help.
                    TARS
          You can use it to find your way
          back to the ship after I blow you
          out the airlock.

Tars looks at Cooper. A beat. An LED turns on. Cooper shakes
his head.
                    COOPER
          What’s your humor setting, Tars?

                    TARS
          One hundred percent.
Cooper turns to the instruments -

                    COOPER
          Take it to seventy-five, please.

EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS

The Rangers streak across the Earth, settle into a low
orbit.

INT. RANGER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Quiet. Cooper stares down at the continents sliding by. He
looks over at Brand who is doing the same, abstracted.
                    COOPER
          We’ll get back.

She stares at the land. The oceans.
          It’s hard. Leaving everything. My
          kids ... your father ...
                    BRAND
          We’re going to spend a lot of time
          together ...
                    COOPER
               (nods)
          We should learn to talk.
                                                        44.


                    BRAND
          And when not to.
               (Off look.)
          Just trying to be honest.

                     COOPER
          Maybe you don’t need to be that
          honest.
               (Turns to Tars.)
          Tars, what’s your honesty
          parameter?

Tars DISENGAGES from the floor and MOVES to the rear airlock
-
                    TARS
          Ninety percent.

                    COOPER
          Ninety? What kind of robot are you?
                    TARS
          Absolute honesty isn’t always the
          most diplomatic, or safe form of
          communication with emotional
          beings.
Cooper turns to Brand. Shrugs.

                    COOPER
          Ninety percent honesty it is, then.
Brand looks at Cooper. Can’t help smiling.

                    VOICE
               (over radio)
          Sixty seconds out...

EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS

The Rangers approach a RING MODULE,   fire retro-thrusters and
slide gracefully into the center of   the ring - the last
piece of a large modular craft: the   U.S.S. ENDURANCE. Four

Brand, Doyle and Romilly, following Tars, FLOAT through the

Cooper hits a switch ...

EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS
Thrusters silently fire on the Endurance. It starts
ROTATING.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
The crew members settle in as gravity is established.
Romilly is clearly struggling to find his sea legs in the
rotating ship.
                    BRAND
          You okay there?

                    ROMILLY
          Yup. Just need a little time -
                    BRAND
          There should be Dramamine in the
          hab pod.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - LATER
The crew listen to Professor Brand over the video link -
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
               (on screen)
          I miss you already. Amelia, be
          safe. Give my regards to Dr Mann.
                    BRAND
          I will, Dad.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
               (on screen)
          Things look good for your
          trajectory. We’re calculating two
          years to Saturn.

                    ROMILLY
          That’s a lot of Dramamine ...
Cooper thinks about two years. What it means to his kids.

                    COOPER
               (on screen)
          Keep an eye on my family, sir.
          Specially Murph. She’s a smart one.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
               (on screen)
          We’ll be waiting when you get back
          ...


INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE - LATER
Cooper and Doyle flick switches and check instruments -
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
               (V.O.)
          ... A little older. A little wiser.
          But happy to see you ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Brand, Romilly, Tars and Case strap in.
                     PROFESSOR BRAND

Cooper turns to Doyle. HITS the thrusters.


EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS
Endurance’s main engines FIRE. The craft PUSHES out of orbit

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
               (V.O.)
          ’Rage, rage against the dying of
          the light.’ God speed, Endurance.

The craft accelerates away from Earth.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY
The crew sets up their CRYO-BEDS. Cooper looks out at the
diminishing Earth floating in the void. Brand joins him.
                      COOPER
          So alone.
                    BRAND
          We’ve got each other - Dr Mann had
          it worse.
                    COOPER
               (points at Earth)
          I meant them. Look at that perfect
          planet. We’re not gonna find
          another one like her.
                    BRAND
          No. This isn’t like looking for a
          new condo - the human race is going
          to be adrift ... desperate for a
          rock to cling to while they catch
          their breaths. We have to find that
          rock. Our three prospects are at
          the edge of what might sustain
          human life.
Brand shows him a blurry image of a dark blue planet.
          Laura Miller’s first. She started
          our biology program.

She shows him a red world, just a tiny dot.
          And Wolf Edmunds is here.
Cooper hears something in her voice.
                                                      48.


                    COOPER
          Who’s Edmunds?
                    BRAND
               (fondly)
          Wolf’s a particle physicist.

                    COOPER
          None of them had family?
                    BRAND
          No attachments. My father insisted.
          They knew the odds against ever
          seeing another human being. I’m
          hoping we surprise at least three
          of them.

                    COOPER
          Tell me about Dr Mann.
Brand replaces the screen image for a grainy, white orb.
                    BRAND
          Remarkable. The best of us. My
          father’s protégé. He inspired
          eleven people to follow him on the
          loneliest journey in human history.
          Scientists, explorers ... That’s
          what I love - out there we face
          great odds. Death. But not evil.
                    COOPER
          Nature can’t be evil?
                    BRAND
          Formidable, frightening - not evil.
          Is a tiger evil because it rips a
          gazelle to pieces?
                    COOPER
          Just what we bring with us, then.
                    BRAND
          This crew represents the best
          aspects of humanity.

                     COOPER
          Even me?
Brand looks at him. Smiles.
                                                      49.


                    BRAND
          Hey, we agreed, ninety percent.
Brand moves to her cryo-bed. Cooper looks out at space.
                    BRAND
          Don’t stay up too late. We can’t
          spare the resources.
                    COOPER
          Hey, I’ve been waiting a long time
          to be up here -
                    BRAND
          You are literally wasting your
          breath.

Cooper nods at her. Joins Tars.
                    COOPER
          Show me the trajectory again.
                    TARS
          Eight months to Mars, then
          counter-orbital slingshot around -
Brand’s cryo-bed darkens.
                    COOPER
               (whisper)
          Tars? Was Dr Brand -
                     TARS
          Why are you whispering? You can’t
          wake them.

                    COOPER
          Were Dr Brand and Edmunds ...
          close?

                    TARS
          I wouldn’t know.
                    COOPER
          Is that ninety percent, or ten
          percent ’wouldn’t know’?

                    TARS
          I also have a discretion setting.
                    COOPER
          So I gather ...

                    COOPER (cont’d)
          But not a poker face.
Tars watches Cooper head for the comm. station. He sits down
to record a message. Awkward. Stuck. He dives in -
          Hey, guys. I’m about settle down
          for the long nap, so I figured I’d
          send you an update ...

EXT. OUTER SPACE - CONTINUOUS

The Endurance slips away from the small blue planet ...
                    COOPER
               (V.O.)
          The Earth looks amazing from here
          ... you can’t see any of the dust -

EXT. CORNFIELDS - DAY
A line of dust slides across the shimmering horizon.

                    COOPER
               (V.O.)
          Hope you guys are doing great. This
          should get to you okay ...


EXT. FRONT PORCH, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Donald watches two approaching vehicles kick up dust.
                    COOPER
               (V.O.)
          Professor Brand said he’d make sure
          of it. Guess I’ll say good night.
Donald recognizes Cooper’s truck ... Murph BURSTS out of the
house -

                     MURPH
               (quiet)
          Is it him?

                    DONALD
          I don’t think so, Murph.
Donald rises to meet the truck. Professor Brand gets out.
                                                         51.


                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          You must be Donald. Hello, Murph.
                    MURPH
          Why’re you in my dad’s truck?

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          He wanted me to bring it for your
          brother.
Silence. Professor Brand reaches into his briefcase.
          He sent you a message -
Murph TURNS and goes back into the house. Donald takes a
disc from Professor Brand.
                    DONALD
          Pretty upset with him for leaving.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          If you record messages, I’ll
          transmit them to Cooper.

Donald nods. Professor Brand looks up at the house.
          Murph’s a bright spark. Maybe I
          could fan the flame.
                    DONALD
          She’s already making fools of her
          teachers. She should come make a
          fool out of you.
Professor Brand smiles. Donald looks up into the blue.
          Where are they?

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Heading towards Mars ...

EXT. MARS - DAY

The Endurance streaks away from Mars ...
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
               (V.O.)
          Next time we hear from Cooper,
          they’ll be coming up on Saturn.

EXT. SATURN - DAY
The Endurance settles into an orbit around the ringed giant.
                    TOM
               (O.S.)
          But they said I can start advanced
          agriculture a year early ...

INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Cooper, blanket around his shoulders, watches a highly
compressed video of Tom -
                    TOM
          Got to go, Dad. Hope you’re safe up
          there.
Tom makes way for Donald:
                     DONALD
          I’m sorry, Coop, I asked Murph to
          say hi, but she’s stubborn as her
          old man. I’ll try again next time,
          stay safe.
The video cuts out. Cooper gets up, puts a pair of EAR BUDS
in his ears and heads into -

INT. HAB POD, RING MODULE - LATER

Cooper enters. Romilly is staring out the window.
                    COOPER
          You good, Rom?

Romilly looks at Cooper.
                    ROMILLY
          It gets to me, Coop. This tin can.
          Radiation, vacuum outside -
          everything wants us dead. We’re
          just not supposed to be here.
Cooper looks at him, sympathetic.
                                                       53.


                    COOPER
          We’re explorers, Rom, on the
          greatest ocean of all.
Romilly bangs on the side of the ship.

                    ROMILLY
          Millimeters of aluminium. That’s
          it. And nothing within millions of
          miles that won’t kill us in
          seconds.

                    COOPER
          A lot of the finest solo yachtsmen
          couldn’t swim. They knew if they
          went overboard that was it, anyway.
          This is no different.

Romilly considers this. Cooper passes him his ear buds -
                     COOPER
          Here -

And the sounds of a THUNDERSTORM wash over Romilly, sounds
that take us to ...

EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS

The Endurance is a tiny speck before the ringed gassy giant.

INT. NAVIGATION, RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks over Doyle’s shoulder - he’s flicking through
images of star fields, distorted as if through a fish-eye
lens.
                    COOPER
          From the relay probe?

                    DOYLE
          It was in orbit around the wormhole
          - each time it swung around we got
          images of the other side of the
          foreign galaxy.

                    COOPER
          Like swinging a periscope around?
                     DOYLE
          Exactly.
                                                      54.

                    COOPER
          So we’ve got a pretty good idea
          what we’re gonna find on the other
          side?
                    DOYLE
          Navigationally.
Brand approaches.

                    BRAND
          We’ll be coming up on the wormhole
          in less than forty-five. Suit up.


INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - LATER
Cooper straps in, peering out at the inky blackness past
Saturn. Romilly joins him there, excited.

As the Endurance streaks past Saturn, it stops rotating,
headed for a DISTORTED BLUR of stars.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

                    ROMILLY
          There!
He points at the SPHERICAL blur of stars.

                    ROMILLY
          That’s it! That’s the wormhole!
                    COOPER
          Say it, don’t spray it, Rom.

                    ROMILLY
          Cooper, this is a portal, cutting
          through spacetime -
               (Points.)
          We’re seeing into the heart of a
          galaxy so far away we don’t even
          know where it is in the universe.
Cooper stares at the wormhole as they approach: a massive
spherical lens into another galaxy.
                                                      55.


                    COOPER
          It’s a sphere.
                    ROMILLY
          Of course it is. You thought it
          would be just a hole?

                    COOPER
          No ... well, in all the
          illustrations -

Romilly grabs a piece of paper, draws two points, far apart
-
                    ROMILLY
          In the illustrations they’re trying
          to show you how it works -

He pokes a hole in one point with his pen ...
          So they say ’You wanna go from here
          to there but it’s too far? A
          wormhole bends space like this ...’

He folds the paper over and jams the pen through the second
point, connecting them.
                    ROMILLY
          ’So you can take a shortcut across
          a higher dimension.’ But to show
          that, they’ve turned
          three-dimensional space ...
               (Gestures around.)
          Into two dimensions.
               (Hold up paper.)
          Which turns the wormhole into two
          dimensions ... a circle.
               (Indicates hole in paper.)
          But what’s a circle in three
          dimensions?

                      COOPER
          A sphere.
                    ROMILLY
          Exactly.
               (Points out window.)
          It’s a spherical hole ...
Cooper marvels at the concept. And at the looming sphere ...
          And who put it here? Who do we
          thank?
                                                         56.

          through it in one piece.

EXT. WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
As the Endurance SWINGS around the wormhole, the view of the

Cooper is at the controls. Doyle is next to him.
                    COOPER
          Any trick to this?
                    DOYLE
          No one knows.
                    COOPER
               (glances at Doyle)
          But the others made it, right?
                    DOYLE
          At least some of them.

                    COOPER
          Thanks for the confidence boost.
Cooper stares down into the vast lens of the wormhole.
          Everybody ready to say goodbye to
          our solar system?

                    ROMILLY
               (over radio)
          To our galaxy ...

Cooper pushes the sticks forward, nosing down and letting
gravity PULL them towards the center of the wormhole ...
                                                      57.


EXT. WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance reaches the surface of the wormhole. As it
crosses the threshold it becomes apparent that THERE IS NO
SURFACE ... the craft simply passes into the space of the
distortion, its own warped reflection flickering towards it
as if the ship were leaning into a giant shaving mirror ...

INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Cooper and Doyle stare at the distortion of space ahead ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand and Romilly look out at reflections bordering the bulk
- a space beyond our three dimensions ...

EXT. WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance moves through a TUNNEL OF DISTORTED
REFLECTIONS, seeming to gather more and more dizzying speed,
but getting no closer to the far mouth, as if on an
accelerating treadmill -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper, awestruck, checks his instruments -
                    DOYLE
          They won’t help you in here. We’re
          cutting through the bulk - space
          beyond our three dimensions ...
               (Checks his equipment.)
          All we can do is record and
          observe.


INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand JUMPS - a shape in the air in front of her is BENDING,
warping to form ripples in spacetime inside the cabin -
Romilly STARES at the distortion -

                    ROMILLY
          What is that?!
Brand watches the distortion move towards her -
                                                      58.


                    BRAND
          I think - I think it’s them.
                    ROMILLY
          Distorting spacetime? Don’t -!

Brand is reaching out towards the warped space - it MOVES
towards her, DISTORTING her hand - but Brand is not in pain
...


INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper and Doyle watch the tunnel mouth STREAK towards them,
a mass of stars and nebulae GROWING ...


EXT. FAR SIDE OF THE WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance slides out of the wormhole.

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Suddenly, the instruments are chirping -
                    DOYLE
          We’re ... here.

Cooper and Doyle look out at the new galaxy ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand’s hand is back to normal. She stares at her fingers.

                    ROMILLY
          What was that?
Brand flexes her fingers, delighted.

                    BRAND
          The first handshake.

EXT. FAR SIDE OF THE WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS

The cosmos is more CROWDED here - STAR upon STAR, NEBULAE
...
                                                   59.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - LATER
Doyle calls up data on a workstation -

                    DOYLE
          The lost communications came
          through -
                       BRAND
          How?
                    DOYLE
          The relay on this side cached them.
Doyle flicks through data -
          Years of basic data - no real
          surprises. Miller’s site has kept
          pinging thumbs up, as has Mann ...
          but Edmunds went down, three years
          ago.

                    BRAND
          Transmitter failure?
                    DOYLE
          Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
          right till it went dark.

                    ROMILLY
          Miller still looks good?
Doyle nods. Romilly is drawing on a whiteboard -
          She’s coming up fast ... with one
          complication - the planet is much
          closer to Gargantua than we
          thought.
                       COOPER
          Gargantua?
                    DOYLE
          A very large black hole. Miller’s
          and Dr Mann’s planets orbit it.

                    BRAND
          And Miller’s is on the horizon?
                    ROMILLY
          A basketball around the hoop.
          Landing there takes us dangerously
          close. A black hole that big has a
          huge gravitational pull.
Cooper glances around the concerned faces -
                                                      60.


                    COOPER
          Look, I can swing around that
          neutron star to decelerate -
                    BRAND
          It’s not that, it’s time. That
          gravity will slow our clock
          compared to Earth’s. Drastically.
                     COOPER
          How bad?

                    ROMILLY
          Every hour we spend on that planet
          will be maybe ... seven years back
          on Earth.

                     COOPER
          Jesus -
                    ROMILLY
          That’s relativity, folks.

                    COOPER
          We can’t drop down there without
          considering the consequences.
                    DOYLE
          Cooper, we have a mission - COOPER
          That’s easy for you to say - you
          don’t have anyone back on Earth
          waiting for you, do you?
                    DOYLE
          You have no idea what’s easy for
          me.
                    BRAND
          Cooper’s right. We have to think of
          time as a resource, just like
          oxygen and food. Going down there
          is going to cost us.
Doyle steps up to the screen, points out three planets.
                    DOYLE
          Look, Dr Mann’s data is promising,
          but we won’t get there for months.
          Edmunds is even further. Miller
          hasn’t sent much, but what she has
          sent is promising - water, organics
          ...
                                                        61.

                    BRAND
          You don’t find that every day.
          DOYLE No, you do not. So think
          about the resources it would take
          to come back here ...
They look at each other, considering. Cooper turns to
Romilly -

                    COOPER
          How far off the planet do we have
          to stay to be out of the time
          shift?
Romilly indicates a spot on his white board.

                    ROMILLY
          Just back from the cusp.
                    COOPER
          So we track a wider orbit of
          Gargantua, parallel with Miller’s
          planet but a little further out ...
          take a Ranger down, grab Miller and
          her samples, debrief and analyze
          back here

                     BRAND
          That’ll work.
                    COOPER
          No time for monkey business down
          there - Tars, you’d better wait up
          here. Who else?
                    ROMILLY
          If we’re talking about a couple
          years - I’d use that time to work
          on gravity - observations from the
          wormhole. That’s gold to Professor
          Brand.
                    COOPER
          Okay. Tars, factor an orbit of
          Gargantua - minimal thrusting -
          conserve fuel - but stay in range.
                     TARS
          Don’t worry, I wouldn’t leave you
          behind ...
               (Swivels around.)
          Dr Brand.
She smiles at him.
                                                      62.


EXT. BLACK HOLE, GARGANTUA - DAY
A black sphere sucking light from the cosmos, visible by its
distorting effect on the light of stars behind it - squeezed
into a GLOWING, CURVED HORIZON. The Endurance approaches.


INT. RANGER COCKPIT - DAY
Cooper looks out at Gargantua. Doyle peers over his shoulder

                    DOYLE
          A literal heart of darkness ...
Brand points to a small glowing planet nearer the blackness.
                    BRAND
          There’s Miller’s planet.
Cooper turns to Case, the machine riding shotgun.
                     COOPER
          Ready?

                     CASE
          Yup.
                    COOPER
          Don’t say much, do you?

                    CASE
          Tars talks plenty for both of us.
Cooper chuckles as he throws a final switch -

                     COOPER
          Detach -

EXT. ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger DETACHES from the ring module, like an X-1 from a
B-29, FIRES retro-thrusters to slow and ... DROPS -

EXT. THE BLACK HOLE, GARGANTUA - DAY

The Ranger SHOOTS down towards Gargantua -
                                                      63.

               (into radio)
          Romilly, you reading these forces?

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Romilly studies data, marveling.
                    ROMILLY
          Unbelievable.
               (Looks out at Gargantua.)
          If we could see the collapsed star
          inside, the singularity, we’d solve
          gravity.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper looks down at the eerie blackness sliding beneath -
                    COOPER
          No way to get anything from it?
                    ROMILLY
               (over radio)
          Nothing escapes that horizon. Not
          even light. The answer’s there,
          just no way to see it.


EXT. GARGANTUA - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger looks tiny as it STREAKS over the blackness, high
above the GLOWING HORIZON. It is approaching Miller’s
planet, a gleaming dark-blue world ...


INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper studies his trajectory.

                    CASE
          This is fast for atmospheric entry.
          Should we use the thrusters to
          slow?
                                                         64.


                    COOPER
          We’re gonna use the Ranger’s
          aerodynamics to save the fuel.
                       CASE
          Air brake?
                    COOPER
          Wanna get in fast, don’t we?
                    CASE
          Brand, Doyle, get ready.

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger STREAKS down towards the planet. It starts to
encounter the STRATOSPHERE -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The craft starts to HOWL and SHAKE. Cooper studies the
curving horizon, concentrating -
                    CASE
          We should ease -
                    COOPER
          Hands where I can see them, Case!
          Only time I ever went down was a
          machine easing at the wrong moment
          -
                    CASE
          A little caution -
                    COOPER
          Can get you killed, same as
          reckless.

                    DOYLE
          Cooper! Too damn fast!
                    COOPER
          I got this.

Cooper squeezes the shaking controls with white knuckles -
                    CASE
          Should I disable the feedback?
                                                       65.

EXT. STRATOSPHERE, MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger glows WHITE HOT, slicing through FLAT CLOUDS -

Cooper peers out at the razor-like layers of cloud -

          Do we have a fix on the beacon?
                    CASE
          Got it. Can you maneuver?
                    COOPER
          Gotta shave more speed. I’ll try
          and spiral down on it -

Doyle looks at Brand, nervous. She takes a breath.

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger CUTS through cloud formations, BURSTING out into
CLEARER AIR, HIGH ABOVE AN ENDLESS OCEAN -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The crew peer at SPARKLING WATER, streaking below them -

          Fire!


EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger’s retro-rockets FIRE - killing the craft’s speed
just feet from the surface. Water SPRAYS UP as the Ranger
SLEWS diagonally, gear is lowered, the Ranger drops, its
landing gear holding it just above the shallow water.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Everyone BOUNCES with the impact. Then BREATHES.

                    BRAND
          Very graceful.
                    COOPER

          What’re you waiting for? Go!
Brand and Doyle hurry out of their harnesses, helmets on.
Case moves to the hatch. With a CRACK, the hatch opens and
LIGHT and SPRAY whip inside ...

Case climbs quickly from the craft, knee deep in the water.
Brand and Doyle follow. Case TRACKS the beacon.

          This way, about two hundred meters.
Brand and Doyle peer into the distance. Smooth, ankle-deep

Brand joins him, searching the shallows for some sign of
Miller’s mission. She looks up, confused.

Cooper looks the other direction ... there is a MOUNTAIN
WAVE BEARING DOWN ON THE SHIP ...

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Brand is searching the wreckage -.
                    COOPER
               (over radio)
          Brand, get back here!
                    BRAND
          We need the recorder -

Doyle looks from Brand to Case, who is loading the beacon.
Beyond him Doyle sees the mountain wave approaching -
                    DOYLE
          Case, go get her!


INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper hits the dash, frustrated.
                    COOPER
          Dammit! Brand, get back here!

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Brand sloshes along, checking DEBRIS -

                    BRAND
          We can’t leave without her data -
                    COOPER
               (over radio)
          You don’t have time!
Case is back at Doyle.
                    DOYLE
          Go, go!

Case takes off towards Brand, who is trying to lift a piece
of equipment from the water. She drops it and moves on -

EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper swings open the hatch, stands in the doorway, peering
out at the approaching mountain waves - turns back to Brand
-
                                                      70.

                    COOPER
          Get back here! Now!

Brand has pulled something heavy from the wreckage - she
SLIPS, the wreckage PINNING her down ... She looks back at
the Ranger - sees the mountain wave THOUSANDS OF FEET HIGH
ALMOST UPON THEM -
                    BRAND
          Cooper, go! Go! I can’t make it!
Cooper looks at Case RACING towards her -
                    COOPER
          Get up, Brand!

                    BRAND
          GO! GET OUT OF HERE!
Case THROWS her onto his back and starts running. Doyle
stands, mesmerized by the sheer liquid mountain face ...

                    COOPER
          Doyle! Come on! Case has her!
Doyle turns, starts sloshing back, the water RUNNING against
his ankles now ... Two hundred yards behind, Case POUNDS
through the shallows, Brand on his back -
Cooper looks up at the EVER CLOSER MOUNTAIN WAVE - jumps
inside.


INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper powers up, as the wall of liquid fills his view.
                    COOPER
          Come on, come on ...
He sees the water right upon them - RUNS back to the hatch.
Doyle is at the foot of the ladder, Case RUNNING FAST.
                    DOYLE
          Go!
Case JUMPS up the ladder, THROWS Brand inside - TURNS for
Doyle. The Ranger TILTS, RISES - DOYLE IS RIPPED FROM CASE’S
HAND - WATER RAGES ACROSS THE OPEN HATCH -

                    COOPER
          Shut the hatch!
Case shuts the hatch. Cooper is throwing switches -
                                                        71.


                    COOPER
          Power down! Power down! We have to
          ride it out!
               (To Brand, furious.)
          We are not prepared for this!


EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Doyle is DRAGGED under and away. The Ranger is SUCKED
SIDEWAYS up the face of the mountain -


INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Brand and Cooper are thrown across the cockpit. Case GRABS
Brand, pulls her into her seat - Cooper holds on as the
craft ROLLS and ROLLS -

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger reaches the top of the wave, rocks upright -


INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper drops into his seat as the water pours off the canopy
-


EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger tilts over the backside of the wave, SURFING for
a second then PITCHING FORWARD - TUMBLING DOWN 8,000 FEET
...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
They hang on for dear life, THRASHED MERCILESSLY -


EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger comes AGROUND as the wave leaves it behind ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The craft comes to rest. Cooper jumps to the controls,
powers up the electrics. The engines won’t respond -

EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The gear LIFTS the Ranger. Water FLOODS out -


INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper tries the engines again. Nothing.

                    CASE
          Too waterlogged. Let it drain.
                    COOPER
               (hits console)
          GODDAMN!

                    BRAND
          I told you to leave me.
                    COOPER
          And I told you to get your ass back
          here! Difference is, only one of us
          was thinking about the mission -
                    BRAND
          Cooper, you were thinking about
          getting home - I was trying to do
          the right thing!
                    COOPER
          Tell that to Doyle.
Quiet. Cooper looks down at the clock. Bitter.
          How long to drain, Case?
                    CASE
          Forty-five to an hour.

Cooper shakes his head. Pulls his helmet off.
                    COOPER
          The stuff of life, huh? What’s this
          gonna cost us, Brand?

                    BRAND
          A lot. Decades.
Cooper rubs his face. Mind reeling. Trying to breathe.
                                                      73.


                    COOPER
          What happened to Miller?
                    BRAND
          Judging by the wreckage, she was
          broken up by a wave soon after
          impact.
                    COOPER
          How could the wreckage still be
          together after all these years?

                    BRAND
          Because of the time slippage. On
          this planet’s time, she landed here
          just hours ago. She might’ve only
          died minutes ago.

Case indicates the beacon.
                     CASE
          The data Doyle received was just
          the initial status, echoing
          endlessly.
Cooper takes this in. Breathes hard. Takes off his gloves.
                    COOPER
          We’re not prepared for this, Brand.
          You’re a bunch of eggheads without
          the survival skills of a boy-scout
          troop.
                    BRAND
          We got this far on our brains -
          farther than any humans in history
          -
                    COOPER
          Not far enough. And we’re stuck
          here till there won’t be anyone
          left on Earth to save -
                    BRAND
          I’m counting every second, same as
          you, Cooper.

Cooper takes this in. They’re in the same boat.
                     COOPER
          Don’t you have some clever way we
          jump into a black hole and get back
          the years?
                                                        74.


She shakes her head, dismissive.
                    COOPER
          Don’t just shake your head at me -!
                    BRAND
          Time is relative - it can stretch
          and squeeze - but it can’t run
          backwards. The only thing that can
          move across dimensions like time is
          gravity.

                    COOPER
               (thinks)
          The beings who led us here ... they
          communicate through gravity ...

Brand nods.
          Could they be talking to us from
          the future?
                    BRAND
               (considers)
          Maybe ...
                    COOPER
          Well, if they can -
                    BRAND
          Look, Cooper, they’re creatures of
          at least five dimensions - to them
          time may be just another physical
          dimension. To them the past might
          be a canyon they can climb into and
          the future a mountain they can can
          climb up ... but to us it’s not,
          okay?
Brand pulls her helmet off. Looks Cooper in the eyes.

                    BRAND
          I’m sorry, Cooper. I screwed up.
          But you knew about relativity.
                    COOPER
          My daughter was ten. I couldn’t
          explain Einstein’s theories before
          I left.
                    BRAND
          Could you tell her you were going
          to save the world?
                                                      75.


                    COOPER
          No. I wasn’t much of a parent, but
          I understood the most important
          thing - let your kids feel safe.
          Which rules out telling a
          ten-year-old that the world’s
          ending.
                    CASE
          Cooper?

Case is pointing out at another MOUNTAIN RANGE.
                    COOPER
          How long for the engines?
                    CASE
          A minute or two -

The mountain wave is approaching. Cooper tries the engines -


EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The rockets COUGH and steam ...

Cooper tries the engines again. Close. But no ignition.
                    COOPER
          Helmets on!
The wave is upon them ...
                    COOPER
          Blow our cabin oxygen through the
          main thrusters. We’ll spark it -
Case hits a button - a HISS and SHRIEK of gas escaping ...
Brand seals her helmet just as the cockpit DEPRESSURIZES -

                    COOPER
          Come on, now ...
Cooper hits the engines - they BLAST TO LIFE -

A fiery BLAST sends the Ranger clear of the mountain wave.
Down below, Doyle’s body lies in the shallows, about to be
swept up into the next rush of water ...

Romilly watches as Cooper and Brand enter the Endurance.

                    BRAND
          Hello, Rom.
                    ROMILLY
          I’ve waited years.

                    COOPER
          How many years?
                    ROMILLY
          By now ... it must be -

                    TARS
          Twenty-three years ...
Cooper’s head lowers.

                    TARS
          ... four months, eight days.
Cooper turns away.
                     ROMILLY
          Doyle?
Brand’s eyes flicker down. She shakes her head. She grasps
Romilly’s hands, looks up into his eyes, vulnerable -
                     BRAND
          I thought I was prepared. I knew
          all the theory. Reality’s
          different.
                    ROMILLY
          And Miller?
                    BRAND
          There’s nothing here for us.
Brand looks at Romilly’s wrinkles. His greying beard.
                                                      77.


                    BRAND
          Why didn’t you sleep?
                    ROMILLY
          I did a couple of stretches. But I
          stopped believing you were coming
          back, and something seems wrong
          about dreaming your life away. I
          learned what I could from studying
          the black hole, but I couldn’t send
          anything to your father. We’ve been
          receiving, but nothing gets out.
She looks up at Romilly, not wanting to ask ...
                    BRAND
          Is he still alive?

Romilly nods. Brand closes her eyes with relief.
                    ROMILLY
          We’ve got years of messages stored
          ...

Brand opens her eyes, looks for Cooper. He is in the comm.
booth. He SHUTS the privacy curtain. She looks down.

          Just start at the beginning.
Cooper leans forward as the screen flickers to life: Tom,
still seventeen, turns on the camera.

                      TOM
          Hi, Dad -
Cooper pauses it. Prepares himself. Lets it run -

          I met another girl, Dad. I really
          think this is the one -

Tom holds up a picture of himself and a teenage GIRL.
          Murph stole Grandpa’s car. She
          crashed it - she’s okay, though.
          Your truck’s still running -
          Grandpa said she should steal that
          next time. I said if she did it’d
          be the last thing she did ...
Cooper leans back ...


INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - DAY
Cooper is holed up, still watching, unshaved. He’s been
watching for days. On the screen, Tom is in his twenties -
                    TOM
          I’ve got a surprise for you, Dad.
          You’re a grandpa ...
Tom holds up an infant wrapped tight in swaddling.
          Congratulations. Meet Jesse.

Cooper smiles a tearful smile.
          Grandpa said he already earned the
          ’great’ part so we just leave it at
          that.

The screen cuts out. Then comes back on. Tom in his thirties
-
          Hi, Dad. I’m sorry it’s been
          awhile. What with Jesse and all ...
He stops, emotional.
          Grandpa died last week. We buried
          him out in the back forty, next to
          Mom and Jesse.
               (Looks down.)
          Where we’d have buried you, if
          you’d ever come back.
               (Looks up.)
          Murph was there for the funeral. I
          don’t see her so much anymore.
               (Sighs.)
          You’re not listening to this. I
          know that. All these messages are
          just out there, drifting in the
          darkness ... I figured as long as
          they were willing to send them
          there was some hope, but ...
                                                      79.


               (Pauses.)
          You’re gone. You’re never coming
          back. And I’ve known that for a
          long time. Lois says - that’s my
          wife, Dad - she says I have to let
          you go. So I am.
               (Reaches up to turn off
               camera.)
          Wherever you are, I hope you’re at
          peace. Goodbye, Dad.

The screen goes black. Tears are streaming down Cooper’s
face. He stares at the black screen, wiping his face. He
starts to get up - the screen flickers to life once more -
A beautiful WOMAN of about forty has turned on the camera -
she looks at us, unsure about this. Makes a start -

                    WOMAN
          Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.
Cooper peers into the face, recognizing -

                    COOPER
               (whispers)
          Murph?
                    WOMAN (MURPH)
          I never made one of these when you
          were still responding cos I was so
          mad at you for leaving. When you
          went quiet, it seemed like I should
          just live with my decision. And I
          have ...
               (Looks around.)
          But today’s my birthday. And it’s a
          special one because you once told
          me -
She stops, unable to speak for a second.

                    MURPH
          You once told me that when you came
          back we might be the same age ...
          and today I’m the age you were when
          you left ...
               (Starts crying.)
          So it’d be a real good time for you
          to come back.
Murph reaches up, switches off the camera and we stay with
her in -

               (O.S., softly)
          I didn’t mean to intrude.
Murph turns to see Professor Brand, now ELDERLY, in a
WHEELCHAIR in the doorway.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          I’ve never seen you in here before.
Murph rises -

                    MURPH
          I’ve never been in here before.
Murph wheels Professor Brand out into the corridor.


INT. CURVING CORRIDOR, NASA - MOMENTS LATER
Murph pushes Professor Brand.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          I talk to Amelia all the time. It
          helps. I’m glad you’ve started -
                    MURPH
          I haven’t. I just had something I
          wanted to get out.


INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Professor Brand wheels behind his desk.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          I know they’re still out there.
                    MURPH
          I know.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          There are so many reasons their
          communications might not be getting
          through.

                    MURPH
               (smiles gently)
          I know, Professor.
                                                        81.


                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          I’m not sure which I’m more afraid
          of ... they never come back, or
          they come back to find we’ve
          failed.

She watches his introspection. Brings him back with -
                    MURPH
          Then let’s succeed.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
               (gestures at formula)
          So, back from the fourth iteration,
          let’s run it with a finite set.
Murph has picked up a notebook. Pauses.

                    MURPH
          With respect, Professor. We’ve
          tried that hundreds of times.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          And it only has to work once,
          Murph.
She shrugs. Starts to work.


INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - LATER
Murph and Professor Brand sit, eating sandwiches on a
walkway. WORKERS move about the CIRCULAR CHAMBER, building
more SIDEWAYS INFRASTRUCTURE. Professor Brand looks down,
proud.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          Every rivet they drive in could
          have been a bullet. We’ve done well
          for the world, here. Whether or not
          we crack the equation before I kick
          -
                    MURPH
          Don’t be morbid, Professor.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          I’m not afraid of death, Murph. I’m
          an old physicist - I’m afraid of
          time.
                                                         82.


INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Murph stands before the algebra. She REALIZES something.
                    MURPH
          Time ... you’re afraid of time ...

CONVINCED, she TURNS -
          Professor, the equation ...?
He looks up.
          For years we’ve tried to solve it
          without changing the underlying
          assumptions about time -
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          And?

                    MURPH
          And that means each iteration
          becomes an attempt to prove its own
          proof - it’s recursive. Nonsensical
          -

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
               (sharp)
          Are you calling my life’s work
          ’nonsense’, Murph?

                    MURPH
          No, I’m saying you’ve been trying
          to finish it with one arm - no,
          with both arms tied behind your
          back ...

Murph focuses on Professor Brand, suddenly WARY ...
          ... and I don’t understand why.
Professor Brand looks down. Starts wheeling his chair.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
          I’m an old man, Murph. Could we
          pick this up some other time? I’d
          like to go talk to my daughter.
Murph nods. Looking at the Professor. Confused.

                    PROFESSOR BRAND
               (V.O.)
          Stepping out into the universe, we
          must first confront the reality
          that nothing in our solar system
          can help us ...
                                                      83.


INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - NIGHT
Brand watches her father on screen.
                    PROFESSOR BRAND
               (V.O.)
          ... then we must confront the
          realities of interstellar travel.
          We must venture far beyond the
          reach of our own life spans. We
          must think not as individuals, but
          as a species ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY
Romilly, Brand, Cooper, Tars and Case sit in discussion.

                    COOPER
          Tars kept the Endurance right where
          we needed her, but it took years
          longer than we anticipated ...

Cooper puts both planets on screen - Dr Mann’s ice world,
and Edmunds’ desert planet.
                    COOPER
          We don’t have the fuel to visit
          both prospects. We have to choose.

                    ROMILLY
          How? They’re both promising.
          Edmunds’ data was better, but Dr
          Mann is the one still transmitting.

                    BRAND
          We’ve got no reason to suppose
          Edmunds’ results would have soured.
          His world has key elements to
          sustain human life -

                    COOPER
          As does Dr Mann’s.
                    BRAND
          Cooper, this is my field. And I
          really believe Edmunds’ is the
          better prospect.
                      COOPER
                 (challenging)
          Why?
                                                       84.


                    BRAND
          Gargantua, that’s why.
               (Steps to board.)
          Look at Miller’s world -
          hydrocarbons, organics, yes. But no
          life. Sterile. We’ll find the same
          thing on Dr Mann’s.
                    ROMILLY
          Because of the black hole?

                    BRAND
               (nods)
          Murphy’s Law - whatever can happen
          will happen. Accident is the first
          building block of evolution - but
          when you’re orbiting a black hole
          not enough can happen - it sucks in
          asteroids and comets, random events
          that would otherwise reach you. We
          need to go to further afield.
                    COOPER
          You once referred to Dr Mann as the
          ’best of us’.
                    BRAND
          He’s remarkable. We’re only here
          because of him.

                    COOPER
          And he’s there on the ground
          sending an unambiguous message that
          we should go to that planet.

Brand is silent. Romilly looks from Brand to Cooper.
                    ROMILLY
          Should we vote?

                    COOPER
          If we’re going to vote, there’s
          something you need to know. Brand?
She says nothing.
          He has a right to know.

                    BRAND
          That has nothing to do with it.
                       ROMILLY
          What does?
                                                      85.

                    COOPER
          She’s in love with Wolf Edmunds.

                    ROMILLY
               (to Brand)
          Is that true?
                    BRAND
          Yes. And that makes me want to
          follow my heart. But maybe we’ve
          spent too long trying to figure all
          this with theory -
                    COOPER
          You’re a scientist, Brand -

                     BRAND
          I am. So listen to me when I tell
          you that love isn’t something we
          invented - it’s observable,
          powerful. Why shouldn’t it mean
          something?
                    COOPER
          It means social utility - child
          rearing, social bonding -

                    BRAND
          We love people who’ve died ...
          where’s the social utility in that?
          Maybe it means more - something we
          can’t understand, yet. Maybe it’s
          some evidence, some artifact of
          higher dimensions that we can’t
          consciously perceive. I’m drawn
          across the universe to someone I
          haven’t seen for a decade, who I
          know is probably dead. Love is the
          one thing we’re capable of
          perceiving that transcends
          dimensions of time and space. Maybe
          we should trust that, even if we
          can’t yet understand it.

Brand looks at Romilly, who can’t meet her eye.
                     BRAND
          Cooper, yes - the tiniest
          possibility of seeing Wolf again
          excites me. But that doesn’t mean
          I’m wrong.
Cooper thinks back to his conversation with Donald.
                                                        86.


                    COOPER
          Honestly, Amelia ... it might.
Romilly looks at Brand. It’s clear she’s lost.
                    COOPER
          Tars, set the course for Dr Mann.
Brand is starting to tear up. She turns away.

Brand is checking her POPULATION BOMB. Cooper enters.
                    COOPER
          Brand, I’m sorry.

                    BRAND
          Why? You’re just being objective.
               (Beat.)
          Unless you’re punishing me for
          screwing up on Miller’s planet.

                    COOPER
          This wasn’t a personal decision for
          me.
Brand turns from her equipment. Looks him in the eye.

                    BRAND
          Well, if you’re wrong, you’ll have
          a very personal decision to make.
               (Off look.)
          Your fuel calculations are based on
          a return journey. Strike out on Dr
          Mann’s planet, and we’ll have to
          decide whether to return home, or
          push on to Edmunds’ planet with
          Plan B. Starting a colony could
          save us from extinction.
She closes the population bomb.
          You might have to decide between
          seeing your children again ... and
          the future of the human race.

          Should make it up.

          No, I need to ...
Murph looks upstairs. At Lois.
          Too many memories, Lois.
She nods. Coop helps Tom clear. As Coop takes Murph’s plate
he starts COUGHING. Looks up at her, sees her concern,

           No. I’ll finish what you started.
Professor Brand looks up into Murph’s eyes, tears welling.

           Murph. Good, good Murph. Such faith

           Forgive me, Murph ...

                     MURPH
           There’s nothing to forgive.
                     PROFESSOR BRAND
           I lied, Murph. I lied to you ...

Murph looks at Professor Brand, confused.
                     PROFESSOR BRAND
           There’s no reason to come back ...
           no way to help us ...

           But Plan A - all this - all these

But Professor Brand slowly shakes his head, tears rolling
down. As Murph tries to comprehend, he settles, DRIFTING.

          ...?! You left us here. To die.
          Never coming back ...
Through the window we see the Ranger moving away, towards -
                                                         91.

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
The Endurance orbits the silvery white globe as the Ranger
heads towards the planet.

EXT. STRATOSPHERE - MOMENTS LATER
The Ranger drops through layers of large, MOUNTAINOUS CLOUD.


INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper and Tars, Brand and Romilly. Cooper peers out,
concerned, studying a heads-up display of CLOUD DENSITY ...


EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger cuts through one cloud, banks left and SCRAPES
AGAINST THE NEXT ’CLOUD’, PANELS TEARING FROM THE WING - THE
CLOUDS ARE ACTUALLY SOLID ICE FORMATIONS ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper banks away from the ICE, glancing out at the damage -


EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger moves cautiously through the ’cloudscape’ like a
ship through an ice field ...


INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Romilly and Brand put their helmets on. Tars indicates the
beacon’s position. Cooper looks, BANKS the Ranger.


EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger’s gear lowers as it comes to rest, tentatively,
at the base of what looks like a large CUMULUS CLOUD.


EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - LATER
Cooper leads them up the ICE CLOUD. From a distance, they
are walking on a cloud. Tars brings up the rear.

Cooper crests a ridge. SPOTS something. He starts down
towards a dirty orange dot in the cloudscape.
                                                      92.


EXT. DR MANN’S POD - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper is there. The others arrive at the large metal pod -
WEATHERED and DAMAGED over the years, half buried in ice.
Nearby, various WIRE MARKERS stick out of the ice. Tars
starts digging out the hatch.


INT. DR MANN’S POD - LATER
A CRACK of COLD LIGHT, as the outer hatch is wrenched open.
Cooper steps through the airlock, into a CRYPT-LIKE SPACE -
Cooper’s hand sweeps ice from the nameplate of a
cryo-chamber, ’DR MANN’.
Tars fires up the cryo-chamber. The ice starts to melt.

Cooper, helmet off, CRACKS the lid, pushes it back,
revealing a figure in a plastic shroud. Cooper rips the seal
...
Dr Mann’s eyes flicker open. He watches Cooper, breathing,
focusing - reaches up with TREMBLING hands - GRABS Cooper -
PULLS himself up, CHEEK AGAINST CHEEK - SOBBING - hands
desperately CARESSING Cooper’s face. Cooper holds him tight.
                    COOPER
               (whispering)
          It’s okay. It’s okay.

INT. SAME - LATER
Dr Mann sits, blanket over his shoulders, sipping from a
steaming cup. He looks at their faces, marveling.
                    DR MANN
               (cracked, parched)
          Pray you never learn just how good
          it can be to see another face.
               (Shaky sip.)
          I hadn’t much hope to begin with.
          After so much time, I had none. My
          supplies were exhausted. The last
          time I went to sleep, I set no
          waking date.
               (Looks at them all.)
          You have literally raised me from
          the dead.
                                                        93.

                    COOPER
               (smiles)
          Lazarus.

                    DR MANN
               (nods)
          And the others?
                    ROMILLY
          I’m afraid you’re it, sir.
                    DR MANN
          So far, surely?
                    COOPER
          With our situation, there’s not
          much hope of any other rescue.
This hits Dr Mann hard. He looks down at his tea.
                    BRAND
          Dr Mann, tell us about your world.
                    DR MANN
               (smiles gently)
          My world. Yes. Our world, we hope.
          Our world is cold, stark ...


EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
Dr Mann leads the others up to the summit of a cloud.

                    DR MANN
               (V.O.)
          But undeniably beautiful ...
From the top, they watch the planet’s pale sun setting.

                    DR MANN
          The days are sixty-seven cold
          hours, the nights are sixty-seven
          far colder hours ...

They make their way back into the shelter.
                    DR MANN
               (V.O.)
          The gravity is a very pleasant 80
          percent of Earth’s. Up here, where
          I landed, the ’water’ is alkali and
          the ’air’ has too much ammonia in
          it to breathe for more than a few
          minutes ...
                                                   94.

Brand checks readings on Dr Mann’s instruments.

INT. DR MANN’S POD - NIGHT

The crew are captivated by Dr Mann ...
                    DR MANN
          But down at the surface, and there
          is a surface ... the chlorine
          dissipates and the ammonia gives
          way to crystalline hydrocarbons and
          breathable air. To organics.
          Possibly even to life.
               (Off looks.)
          Yes. We may be sharing this world.

                    BRAND
               (giddy)
          These readings are from the
          surface?

Brand is reviewing Dr Mann’s piles of data.
                    DR MANN
          Over the years I’ve dropped various
          probes.

                    COOPER
          How far have you explored?
                    DR MANN
          I’ve mounted several major
          expeditions, but with oxygen in
          limited supply, Kipp there had to
          do most of the legwork.
Dr Mann indicates a DEFUNCT ARTICULATED MACHINE.
                    TARS
          What’s wrong with him?
                    DR MANN
          Degeneration. He misidentified the
          first organics we found as ammonia
          crystals. We struggled on for a
          time, but ultimately, I
          decommissioned him and used his
          power source to keep the mission
          going.
               (Remembers, sadly.)
          I thought I was alone before I shut
          him down.
                                                         95.


                      TARS
            Would you like me to look at him?
                      DR MANN
            No, I think he needs a human touch.

Tars turns to Brand.
                      TARS
            Dr Brand, Case is relaying a
            message for you from the comm.
            station.
She nods.
                      MURPH
                 (V.O.)
            ... He had no pain and was ... at
            peace.

INT. DR MANN’S POD - LATER

Brand watches Murph’s message on Tars’ data screen.
                      MURPH
            I’m sorry for your loss.
Brand STARES. Cooper is there. Murph reaches up -

                      BRAND
                 (abstract)
            Is that Murph?
Cooper nods.
          She’s become a -
                      MURPH
                 (acid)
            Did you know, Brand? Did he tell
            you? That Plan A was a sham ...?!

Cooper looks at Brand, who is shocked.
          You left us here to set up your
          colony. Never coming back ...

Murph does not want to ask, tears are running down her
cheeks -
               (Small.)
          Did my father know? Dad ...?
Cooper stares. Murph’s eyes bore into his ...
          Did you leave me here to die?
                                                      96.


The screen goes dark. Cooper stands there, SHOCKED.
                    BRAND
          Cooper, my father devoted his whole
          life to Plan A - I have no idea
          what she means -

                       DR MANN
                  (O.S.)
          I do.

They turn. Dr Mann looks at them with gentle calm.
                    COOPER
          He never even hoped to get people
          off the Earth.

                       DR MANN
          No.
                    BRAND
          But he’s been trying to solve the
          gravity equation for forty years!

Dr Mann comes over, looks into Brand’s eyes.
                    DR MANN
          Amelia, your father solved his
          equation before I even left.

                    BRAND
          Then why wouldn’t he use it?!
                    DR MANN
          The equation couldn’t reconcile
          relativity with quantum mechanics.
          You need more -
                    COOPER
          More what?!

                    DR MANN
          More data. You need to see inside a
          black hole. And the laws of nature
          prohibit a naked singularity.

                    COOPER
               (to Romilly)
          Is that true?
                    ROMILLY
          If a black hole is an oyster, the
          singularity is the pearl inside.

                                      97.


          ROMILLY (cont’d)
Its gravity is so strong, it’s
always hidden in darkness, behind
the horizon. That’s why we call it
a black hole.

          COOPER
If we could look beyond the horizon
-
          DR MANN
Some things aren’t meant to be
known.
     (To Brand.)
Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from
extinction. Plan B. A colony.

          BRAND
Why not tell people? Why keep
building that damn station?
          DR MANN
He knew how much harder it would be
for people to come together and
save the species, instead of
themselves ...
     (To Cooper, sympathetic.)
Or their children.
            COOPER
Bullshit.
          DR MANN
Would you have left if you hadn’t
believed you were trying to save
them? Evolution has yet to
transcend that simple barrier - we
can care deeply, selflessly for
people we know, but our empathy
rarely extends beyond our line of
sight.
          BRAND
But the lie. A monstrous lie ...

          DR MANN
Unforgivable. And he knew it. Your
father was prepared to destroy his
own humanity to save our species.
He made the ultimate sacrifice.
                                                      98.


                    COOPER
          No. That’s being made by the people
          of Earth who’ll die because, in his
          arrogance, he declared their case
          hopeless.

                    DR MANN
          I’m sorry, Cooper. Their case is
          hopeless. We are the future.
Cooper REELS. Brand puts her hand on his shoulder -

                    BRAND
          Cooper, what can I do?
He turns to her. Looks her in the eyes.

                    COOPER
          Let me go home.
And the sound of WIND in DRY CORNSTALKS takes us -


INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DUSTY PLAIN - DAWN
Murph drives. Getty next to her. In the distance, several
fields BURN.
                    GETTY
          Are you sure?
                    MURPH
          His solution was correct. He’d had
          it for years.

                    GETTY
          It’s worthless?
                    MURPH
          It’s half the answer.

                    GETTY
          How do you find the other half?
Murph points at the sky.

                    MURPH
          Out there? A black hole. Stuck here
          on Earth? I’m not sure you can.
They pass vehicles PILED HIGH with belongings and people.
                                                      99.


                    GETTY
          They just pack up and leave. What
          are they hoping to find?
                    MURPH
          Survival.
               (Looks ahead.)
          Dammit!
A DUST STORM SWAMPS the truck, killing visibility. Murph
pulls over. Kills the engine. The wind rocks the car.

                    GETTY
          Don’t people have a right to know?
                    MURPH
          Panic won’t help. We have to keep
          working, same as ever.
                     GETTY
          Isn’t that just what Professor
          Brand ...?

                    MURPH
               (sharp)
          Brand gave up on us - I’m still
          trying to solve this.
                    GETTY
          So you have an idea?
                    MURPH
          No. I have a ... feeling.

Getty looks at her as she STARES out at the dust.
INSERT CUT: MURPH (TEN), wet hair, towel around neck, turns
and STARES at a book on the floor -
                    MURPH
               (V.O.)
          I told you about my ghost ...
She stoops to pick up the toy next to it - a broken LUNAR
LANDER.

MURPH (FORTY) puts her hands on the glass, watching the sand
scrape the car’s window ...
                    MURPH
          My dad thought I called it a ghost
          because I was scared of it ...

          But I was never scared of it ...

MURPH (TEN) takes out her notebook and starts drawing lines
to represent the books.
                    MURPH
               (V.O.)
          I called it a ghost because it felt

MURPH (FORTY) turns to Getty.

                    MURPH
          Like a person. Trying to tell me
          something ...
The storm is clearing. Murph starts the engine.
          If there’s an answer here on Earth,
          it’s back there, somehow. No one’s
          coming to save us.
               (Pulls out.)
          I have to find it ...
Murph pulls past a pickup piled with worldly goods and
people. She makes eye contact with two filthy kids in the
back ...
          And we’re running out of time.


EXT. RANGER, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAWN
Tars is up on the wing of the Ranger. Case pilots the LANDER
in to land near the Ranger.


INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper is sitting with his feet on the console.
                     CASE
               (over radio)
          What about auxiliary oxygen
          scrubbers?
                    COOPER
          They can stay. I’ll sleep most of
          the journey.

                    COOPER (cont’d)
          I saw it all on the way out here.
Romilly comes through the airlock. Removes his helmet.

                    ROMILLY
          I have a suggestion for your return
          journey.
                    COOPER
          What?

                    ROMILLY
          Have one last crack at the black
          hole ...
Tars enters.

                    ROMILLY
          Gargantua’s an older, spinning
          black hole - what we call a gentle
          singularity.

                    COOPER
          Gentle?
                    ROMILLY
          They’re hardly gentle, but their
          tidal gravity is quick enough that
          something crossing the horizon fast
          might survive ... a probe, say.
                    COOPER
          What happens to it after it
          crosses?
                    ROMILLY
          Beyond the horizon is a complete
          mystery - who’s to say there isn’t
          some way the probe can glimpse the
          singularity and relay the quantum
          data? If he’s equipped to transmit
          every form of energy that can pulse
          - X-ray, visible light, radio -
                    TARS
          Just when did this probe become a
          ’he’?
Romilly looks from Tars to Cooper, sheepish.
                                                     102.

                    ROMILLY
          Tars is the obvious candidate. I’ve
          already told him what to look for.
                    TARS
          I’d need to take the old optical
          transmitter from Kipp.
                    COOPER
               (to Tars)
          You’d do this for us?

                    TARS
          Before you get teary, try to
          remember that as a robot I have to
          do anything you say, anyway.

                    COOPER
          Your cue light’s broken.
                    TARS
          I’m not joking.

Bing. The light flashes on.

EXT. RANGER, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY

Brand and Dr Mann approach Cooper and Romilly at the foot of
the ladder. Cooper addresses Brand -
                    COOPER
          Ranger’s almost ready. Case is on
          his way back down with another
          load.
                    BRAND
          I’ll start a final inventory.
                    ROMILLY
          Dr Mann, I need Tars to remove and
          adapt some components from Kipp.
Dr Mann considers this. Looks at Tars. At Romilly.
                     DR MANN
          He musn’t disturb Kipp’s archival
          functions.
                    ROMILLY
          I’ll supervise.

Dr Mann considers this. Nods.
                                                     103.

                    COOPER
          We need to pick out a site. You
          don’t wanna move the module once we
          land it.
                    DR MANN
          I’ll show you the probe sites.
Cooper glances around at the winds picking up -

                    COOPER
          Will conditions hold?
                    DR MANN
          These squalls usually blow over.
          You’ve got a long-range
          transmitter?
Cooper reaches up to check a box plugged in at his neck.
                    COOPER
          Good to go.
Dr Mann points at a nozzle on his elbow -
                     DR MANN
          Charged?

Cooper checks, thumbs up. Dr Mann sets off, Cooper follows.

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - LATER

As Cooper follows Dr Mann down a ridge, they see the lander
fly over. Cooper waves, reaches up to his long-range
transmitter -
                    COOPER
          A little caution, Case?
                    CASE
               (over radio)
          Safety first, Cooper.

Cooper follows Dr Mann down to the edge of the ice. They
peer down a fifty-foot drop.
                    DR MANN
          Just take it gently -

He steps off, DROPPING - his ELBOW JETS FIRE, slowing his
descent in time for him to land with a THUD. Cooper follows.
They set out through a massive CANYON of ice ...
                                                     104.


                    DR MANN
          Brand told me why you feel you have
          to go back -
Cooper STOPS.

                    COOPER
          If this excursion is about trying
          to change my mind, let’s turn
          around right now.

                    DR MANN
          No. I understand your position.
He turns and starts walking. Cooper follows.
                    DR MANN
          You have attachments. I’m not
          supposed to, but even without
          family, I can promise you that the
          yearning to be with other people is
          massively powerful. Our instincts,
          our emotions, are at the
          foundations of what makes us human.
          They’re not to be taken lightly.
The wind WHIPS ice crystals between them ...


INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Murph introduces Getty to Lois and Coop. Getty pulls out a
STETHOSCOPE and starts examining Coop, Murph slips upstairs
...


INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - DAY
Murph opens the door. Stands in her old bedroom. Feeling ...

                    COOP
               (O.S.)
          Mama lets me play in here ...
Murph turns to see Coop. He points at a box on the shelf -
          I don’t touch your stuff.
                                                     105.


EXT. LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Brand turns away as the lander touches down in a spray of
ice.


INT. DR MANN’S POD - CONTINUOUS
Romilly watches Tars crouch down beside Kipp and connect
Kipp to his own power. Kipp shows signs of life ...


EXT. ICE CANYON, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Dr Mann waits for Cooper catch up. The WIND is picking up -
                    DR MANN
          You know why we couldn’t just send
          machines on these missions, Cooper?
                    COOPER
               (breathless)
          Frankly, no.

                    DR MANN
               (pressing on)
          A trip into the unknown requires
          improvisation. Machines can’t
          improvise well because you can’t
          program a fear of death. The
          survival instinct is our single
          greatest source of inspiration.
Dr Mann pauses to take a breath. Turns to Cooper.
          Take you - a father. With a
          survival instinct that extends to
          your kids ...
                    COOPER
          That’s why I’m going home, hopeless
          or not.

                    DR MANN
          And what does research tell us is
          the last thing you’ll see before
          you die?
               (Off look.)
          Your children. At the very moment
          of death, your mind pushes you a
          little harder to survive. For them.
Dr Mann turns and starts walking out onto a massive ice
field.
                                                     106.


INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Murph brings Coop downstairs. Getty is listening to Lois’
back. He looks up at Murph. GRAVE. Shakes his head ...
                    GETTY
          They can’t stay here.
                    TOM
               (O.S.)
          Murph?

Murph turns to see Tom in the doorway.
          What is this ...?

EXT. LANDER, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

Brand is counting flight cases when a WIND whips ice at her
...

INT. DR MANN’S POD - CONTINUOUS

Romilly takes his helmet off, PEERING over Tars’ shoulder at
Kipp’s data screen. Confused.
                    ROMILLY
          I don’t understand.


EXT. ICE FIELD, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Cooper and Dr Mann are like two ants on a sheet.

                    DR MANN
          The first window’s up ahead -
Cooper peers ahead to an OPENING in the ice. Dr Mann stops
at the edge. Looks around the wind-blasted ice plane.
          When I left Earth I felt fully
          prepared to die. But I just never
          faced the possibility that my
          planet wouldn’t be the one. None of
          this turned out the way it was
          supposed to.

                    COOPER
          Professor Brand would disagree.
Cooper peers over the edge at an enormous CREVASSE ...

Dr Mann RIPS COOPER’S LONG-RANGE TRANSMITTER FROM HIS NECK -
                                                     107.


Cooper TURNS to Dr Mann - who BLASTS him with his ELBOW JET.
He SLIPS backwards, but avoids going over the edge -
                    COOPER
          What are you doing?!

Until Dr Mann KICKS him. Cooper hits his jets, pushing
himself onto a lower ledge of ice -

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY

Tom confronts Murph while Getty looks on -
                    MURPH
          They can’t stay here, Tom!

                    GETTY
          Not one more day -
Tom TURNS, PUNCHES Getty - who collapses.
                    LOIS
          Tom?!
                    TOM
          Coop, get your aunt’s things -
          she’s done here.

                    MURPH
          Tom, Dad didn’t raise you this dumb
          -
                    TOM
          Dad didn’t raise us, Grandpa did,
          and he’s buried outside with Mom in
          our ground. I’m not leaving them -
                    MURPH
          You have to, Tom -

                    TOM
          I’m a farmer, Murph! You don’t give
          up on the Earth.
                    MURPH
          No! But she gave up on you! And
          she’s poisoning your family.
                                                      108.


EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
Cooper SCRAMBLES to his knees. Dr Mann approaches -
                    DR MANN
          I’m sorry - I can’t let you leave.

                    COOPER
          Why?!
                    DR MANN
          We’re going to need your ship to
          continue the mission ... once the
          others realize what this place
          isn’t.
Cooper’s mind races. He looks around.

                    COOPER
          You faked all the data?
                    DR MANN
          I had a lot of time.

                    COOPER
          Is there even a surface?
                    DR MANN
          I’m afraid not -

Dr Mann KICKS Cooper over the edge, Cooper CLINGS on -
                    DR MANN
          I tried to do my duty, Cooper, but
          the day I arrived I could see this
          place had nothing. I resisted the
          temptation for years ... but I knew
          there was a way to get rescued.
                    COOPER
          You fucking coward.
Cooper BLASTS Dr Mann off his feet with his jet - SCRAMBLES
up onto the ice. Dr Mann TACKLES him, they go down,
WRESTLING. WIDER shows us two TINY FIGURES in a VAST
LANDSCAPE, deciding the future of humanity with a BRAWL ...
                                                     109.


INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Murph begs Tom -
                    MURPH
          Please, come with us.

                    TOM
          To live underground, praying Dad
          comes back to save us all?

                    MURPH
          He’s not coming back. He was never
          coming back. It’s up to us. To me.
                     TOM
          You’re gonna save the human race,
          Murph? Really? How? Our dad
          couldn’t -
                    MURPH
          HE DIDN’T EVEN TRY!
               (Off look.)
          He just abandoned us, Tom.
Murph looks around, frustrated. Coop hands Murph the box.
                    MURPH
          Tom, if you won’t come, let them -

                    TOM
          Murph.
               (Points at box.)
          Take your stuff, and go. Murph
          hands the box back to Coop.

                       MURPH
          Keep it.
She leaves. Getty follows.

Dr Mann LUNGES at Cooper, who SIDESTEPS him and PINS him ...

          Stop this!
Dr Mann HEADBUTTS COOPER, FACEPLATE IMPACTS FACEPLATE.

                    COOPER
          Mann! Don’t - you’ll kill us both -

CRACK. Dr Mann SMASHES his helmet into Cooper’s AGAIN AND
AGAIN as he -
                    DR MANN
          SOMEONE’S - GLASS - WILL - GIVE -

                    COOPER
          FIFTY-FIFTY YOU KILL YOUR SELF!
          STOP!
Dr Mann STOPS. Looks up at Cooper, BREATHING. Both
faceplates have TINY FRACTURES ...
                    DR MANN
          Best odds I’ve had in years -
WHACK - He BUTTS Cooper’s faceplate, which CRACKS
SICKENINGLY. AMMONIA HISSES INSIDE - COOPER ROLLS OFF, HANDS
UP, DESPERATELY TRYING TO PLUG THE LARGE CRACK -
Dr Mann RISES. Checks the fractures in his own helmet. Bends
down to look at Cooper, STRUGGLING, CHOKING -

                    DR MANN
          Please don’t judge me, Cooper - you
          were never tested like I was. Few

She just stares ahead at the road ...

EXT. ICE FIELD, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY

With curiosity and FEAR, Dr Mann watches Cooper CRAWL ...
                    DR MANN
          You’re feeling it, aren’t you? That
          survival instinct - that’s what
          drove me. It’s always driven the
          human race, and it’s going to save
          it now. I’m going to save it. For
          all mankind. For you, Cooper.
                                                       111.

Unable to watch any more, he RISES, walking away, continuing
to talk to Cooper via the radio ...

                    DR MANN
          I’m sorry, I can’t watch you go
          through this - I thought I could.
          But I’m still here. I’m here for
          you ...

Dr Mann, hurrying away, listens to Cooper RASPING -
                    DR MANN
          Cooper. When you left, did
          Professor Brand read you that poem?
          How does it end ...?

Dr Mann hauls himself up a ledge. The wind WHIPS up ice.

Dr Mann hears only CHOKING, GASPING, HACKING. He kills his
radio. Scared. Watches Cooper’s silent thrashing. TURNS.

Cooper GRABS the transmitter - tries to calm his FRANTIC
HANDS - can’t reconnect it with clumsy gloves - pulls glove

          let Gargantua suck us right to her
          horizon - then a powered slingshot
          around to launch us at Edmunds.

          That’s what I’m here for. I’ll take
          us just inside the critical orbit.
                    BRAND
          And the time slippage?

Cooper slows as he falls towards this sphere, reminiscent of
the wormhole, but the light within is not stars but an
infinity of WORLD LINES - (paths of objects through
spacetime) -
Cooper PLUNGES INTO THE WORLD SPHERE ... As he falls his
SINGLE WORLD LINE stretches behind him - the INFINITE
FUTURES OF HIS WORLD LINE splitting ahead to all the
different possibilities in spacetime -
Cooper himself is now like a ring being pulled down a cone
of fabric. He STARES at the ORDERED CHAOS of world lines ...

become like INFINITE REFLECTIONS IN PARALLEL MIRRORS ...

She turns ... leaves the room ... Cooper floats there,
staring. He LOOKS around - each ’wall’ of the tesseract is a
different view of Murph’s bedroom, so that by rotating he
can effectively orbit her room ...
He claws his way down to the next book wall. PUNCHES out two
books -
Murph’s bedroom, empty. The door opens, Cooper’s EARLIER
SELF is standing there, staring at the room, perturbed.

               (frustrated)
          Who’s ’They’? And why would they
          help us?

          I don’t know, but they constructed
          this three-dimensional space inside
          their five-dimensional reality to
          allow you to understand it ...
                    COOPER
          It isn’t working -!
                    TARS
               (over radio)
          Yes, it is. You’ve seen that time
          is represented here as a physical
          dimension - you even worked out
          that you can exert a force across
          spacetime -

                    COOPER
               (realizing)
          Gravity. To send a message ...
Cooper looks around the infinite tunnel, infinite Coopers.

                    COOPER
          Gravity crosses the dimensions -
          including time -
Cooper THINKS ... He pulls himself up to a different wall,
starts counting books ...
          And you have the quantum data, now
          -
                    TARS
               (over radio)
          I’m transmitting it on all
          wavelengths - but nothing’s getting
          out ...
                    COOPER
          I can do it -
Cooper HITS a book’s world line, sending a WAVE ...
                    TARS
               (over radio)
          Such complicated data ... to a
          child ...
                    COOPER
          Not just any child.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) stands there, looking at her old notebook -
the page that says ’STAY’ ...
                    GETTY
               (O.S.)
          MURPH?! COME ON!
She looks around the room, SEARCHING for an answer ...


EXT. THE TESSERACT - DAY
Cooper watches Murph (ten) looking out the window ...
                    TARS
               (over radio)
          Even if you communicate it here,
          she wouldn’t understand its
          significance for years ...
Cooper is seized by a sudden anger -

                    COOPER
          Then figure something out!
          Everybody on Earth is going to die!
                    TARS
          Cooper, they didn’t bring us here
          to change the past.
Cooper hears something in this -
                    COOPER
          We brought ourselves here ...
Cooper PUSHES off, looking through the gaps in the books.
Murph’s bedroom, full of DUST in the DUST STORM -

                    COOPER
          Tars, feed me the coordinates of
          NASA in binary ...
Cooper is in the room now, drawing a pattern in the dust ...

Cooper watches Murph (ten) burst into the room. Murph stops
and stares at the dust as Cooper’s Earlier Self comes in
past her, SLAMS the window shut - sees the PATTERN of dust
...
                                                      144.


INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) runs her finger along the DUST of the
windowsill ... She turns to look around the room.
Frustrated.

                    MURPH
          Come on, Dad. Is there something
          else here ...?


INT. TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks up from the floor -
                     COOPER
          Don’t you see, Tars? I brought
          myself here. We’re here to
          communicate with the
          three-dimensional world. We’re the
          bridge ...
Cooper moves to another iteration of Murph’s room. Murph
(ten) JUMPS up - GRABS the WATCH, RUNS out the door ...

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) looks at the watch, remembering. The second
hand TWITCHES. She drops the watch back into the box ...

INT. TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper pushes himself along the world line of the books ...

                    COOPER
          I thought they chose me - they
          never chose me - they chose Murph.
                    TARS
               (over radio)
          For what?
                    COOPER
          To save the world!

Murph (ten) comes back into her bedroom, SOBBING. She is
holding the watch. She puts it on the shelf.
                                                       145.


INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) puts the box back on the shelf. SIGHS ...

INT. TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS

Cooper races FASTER and FASTER down the world lines.
                    COOPER
          ’They’ have access to infinite
          time, infinite space ...
Cooper gestures at the INFINITIES in all directions ...
                    COOPER
          But no way to find what they need -
          but I can find Murph and find a way
          to tell her - like I found this
          moment -
                      TARS
                 (over radio)
          How?
                    COOPER
          Love, Tars. Love - just like Brand
          said - that’s how we find things
          here.

                    TARS
               (over radio)
          So what are we here to do?
Cooper looks around the tesseract. The watch sits there on
the shelf for as long as he can see ...
                    COOPER
          The watch. That’s it. She’ll come
          back for it -

                    TARS
          How do you know?
                    COOPER
          Because I gave it to her. We use
          the second hand. Translate the data
          into Morse and feed it to me -
Tars starts to transmit. Cooper GRABS the second-hand world
line - starts to MANIPULATE it, sending waves down the world
line ...
                                                        146.


                    TARS
          What if she never came back for it?
                    COOPER
          She will. She will ... I feel it
          ...

The second hand is FLICKING back and forth ...

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT

Murph (forty) turns to leave ...
                    GETTY
               (O.S.)
          MURPH, HE’S COMING!

She pauses. Goes back to the box - reaches in. PULLS OUT THE
WATCH ... staring at it ... wondering ...
                    GETTY
               (O.S.)
          MURPH?! MURPH ...?!

EXT. FARMHOUSE - TWILIGHT
Getty is holding a tire iron, watching TOM’S TRUCK APPROACH.
Lois and Coop STARE, FEARFUL, from the truck ...
Tom APPROACHES, BLACK from soot ...
Murph BURSTS out of the house ... right up to Tom ...

                    MURPH
          Tom, he came back ... he came back
          ...
                    TOM
          Who?

She holds up the watch ...
                    MURPH
          Dad. It was him. All this time ...
          it was him. He’s going to save us
          ...
CLOSE ON the second hand of the watch, FLICKING back and
forth -
                                                      147.


INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - DAY
Murph furiously TRANSCRIBES the movements of the second hand
-


INT. CORRIDOR, NASA - LATER
Murph, papers in hand, RUNS down the corridor, BUMPS into
Getty - doesn’t stop ...


INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - CONTINUOUS
Murph runs to the railing of the catwalk above the enormous
construction, looks down at the thousands of workers below.
Getty comes out after her, curious. She looks at him, then
SHOUTS OUT to the enormous space ...
                      MURPH
          EU-RE-KA!
She turns to Getty - GRINNING.
          Well, it’s traditional.
She THROWS her paper out over the railing -
          EUREKA!!
Workers look up to see her papers flitting down ...


EXT. THE TESSERACT - DAY
Cooper looks out at the world line of the watch, of Murph,
as it leads out into infinite complexity ...

                    COOPER
          Did it work?
                    TARS
               (over radio)
          I think it might have.
                      COOPER
                 (hopeful)
          Why?

                    TARS
               (over radio)
          Because the bulk beings are closing
          the tesseract ...
                                                     148.


Cooper looks out to the distance - it is RAPIDLY
APPROACHING, WORLD LINES BECOMING WORLD SHEETS, BECOMING
BULKS ...
                    COOPER
          Don’t you get it, yet, Tars? ’They’
          aren’t ’beings’ ... they’re us ...
          trying to help ... just like I
          tried to help Murph ...
                    TARS
               (over radio)
          People didn’t build this tesseract
          -
                    COOPER
          Not yet ... but one day. Not you
          and me but people, people who’ve
          evolved beyond the four dimensions
          we know ...
The tesseract EXPANSION BACK INTO FIVE DIMENSIONS IS ALMOST
UPON THEM - Cooper BRACES HIMSELF -

                    COOPER
          What happens now -?
BAM - he is swept up in the expansion like a tiny leaf on a
CHURNING WAVE -
Cooper FLIES through the EXPANDING COSMOS, past PLANETS
ORBITING STARS, WHICH BECOME ATOMIC PARTICLES, WHICH BECOME
MATTER, BECOMING STARS ...

Cooper APPROACHES A GLASSY TUBE. Inside is the OLD,
UNDAMAGED ENDURANCE. As Cooper looks in from the bulk he
sees: Brand, strapped in, Doyle opposite, traversing the
wormhole for the first time ...
Cooper REACHES for Brand ... She sees something, reaches up
- their hands would touch if they weren’t in different
dimensions, her fingers distorting the space of his fingers
-
WHAM! She, and the Endurance, are SWEPT PAST - Cooper is
SMASHED into the spacetime of the wormhole - he SCREAMS AND
WE -
                                                     149.

INT. OUTER SPACE - LATER
Cooper FLOATS, dead or unconscious, near Saturn. In the
distance we see two Rangers approaching ...

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Cooper’s eyes flicker open. A bright room with an open
window, net curtains obscuring the view. We hear the CRACK
of a baseball off a bat. Children LAUGHING.
                    VOICE
               (O.S.)
          Mr Cooper? Mr Cooper?

Cooper looks over to see a Nurse and a Doctor watching him.
He tries to sit up.
                    DOCTOR
          Take it slow, sir. Remember you’re
          no spring chicken any more.
               (Amused.)
          I gather you’re one hundred and
          twenty-four years old.
               (Checks Cooper’s chart.)
          You were extremely lucky. The
          Rangers found you with only minutes
          left in your oxygen supply -
                    COOPER
          Where am I?

The Doctor, almost surprised, TURNS, moves to the window,
opens the curtains. Where Cooper should see sky, he sees a
CURVING UPSIDE-DOWN TOWN ...
                    DOCTOR
          Cooper Station. Currently orbiting
          Saturn.
The Nurse helps Cooper to the window. He looks out at the
VAST CYLINDRICAL STATION - cornfields and buildings. Outside
his window, kids are playing baseball. The batter hits a POP
FLY ... the kids watch it up and up, until it carries on,
falling up towards the buildings above. The kids SHOUT a
warning - the ball smashes a skylight. Cooper watches the
kids laugh.
                    COOPER
          Nice of you to name the place after
          me.
The Nurse giggles. The Doctor shoots her a look -
                                                     150.


          What?
                    DOCTOR
          The station wasn’t named after you,
          sir ... It was named after your
          daughter.

Cooper smiles at this ...
                    DOCTOR
          Although, she’s always maintained
          just how important you were -
                     COOPER
          Is she ...
               (Braces.)
          still alive?

                    DOCTOR
          She’ll be here in a couple weeks.
          She’s really far too old for a
          transfer from another station, but
          when she heard you’d been found ...
          well, this is Murphy Cooper we’re
          talking about.
                    COOPER
               (marveling)
          Yes, it is ...

The Doctor is wrapping up -
                    DOCTOR
          We’ll have you checked out in a
          couple days.

Cooper turns back to the window, thinking ...
                    ADMINISTRATOR
               (V.O.)
          I’m sure you’ll be excited to see
          what’s in store ...

INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - DAY
The ADMINISTRATOR, thirties, leads Cooper along a walkway -

                    ADMINISTRATOR
          We’ve got a nice situation for you
          ...
                                                     151.


Cooper looks down at a line of SLEEK NEXT-GENERATION
RANGERS. Sees a PILOT climb into one. Mechanics work another
...
                    ADMINISTRATOR
          I actually did a paper on you in
          high school, sir. I know all about
          your life on Earth ...

EXT. TOWN SQUARE, COOPER STATION - CONTINUOUS

Cooper looks at the strangely ordinary town the
Administrator is walking him through ...
                    ADMINISTRATOR
          So when I made my suggestion to Ms
          Cooper, I was delighted to hear
          that she thought it was perfect ...

EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The Adminstrator leads Cooper through a cornfield ... The
old farmhouse is there, preserved. As Cooper approaches, a
small monitor starts playing the footage of OLD-TIMERS from
the start of the movie.
                    ADMINISTRATOR
          Of course, I didn’t speak to her
          personally ...
As Cooper passes the monitor it changes to a FAMILIAR OLD
LADY, but Cooper misses it ...


INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
OLD-TIMERS play on video screens: a museum exhibit. The
Administrator holds the door open for Cooper.

                    ADMINISTRATOR
          But she confirmed just how much you
          loved farming.
                    COOPER
          She did, huh?
Cooper looks over the kitchen. Cooper sees a
familiar-looking articulated machine -
                                                       152.


                    COOPER
          Is that ...?
                    ADMINISTRATOR
          The machine we found out near
          Saturn when we found you, yes. Its
          power source was shot, but we could
          get you another if you want to try
          and get it up and running again.
Cooper turns to the Administrator.

                      COOPER
          Please.

INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - EVENING

Cooper, from the catwalk, watches the last of the Rangers
come back from patrol. The PILOT jumps down as the ground
crew wheels it into its place in the line of sleek ships.


INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Cooper has Tars’ head laid out on the kitchen table.
                    TARS
          Settings: general settings,
          security setting -
                    COOPER
          Honesty. New level setting.
          Ninety-five percent.

                    TARS
          Confirmed. Additional
          customization?
                     COOPER
          Yes. Humor, seventy-five percent.
          Wait.
                (Thinks.)
          Sixty percent.


INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY
Cooper enters, nervous. A nurse is there.
                      COOPER
          Is she -?
                                                     153.


                    NURSE
          The family’s all in there.
                    COOPER
          The family?

                     NURSE
          They all came along to see her -
          she’s been in cryo-sleep for almost
          two years.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cooper cautiously pushes open the door. The bed is
surrounded by people, grown-up children, grandchildren,
babies ... They turn to look at him: some SMILES, some
CURIOUS looks, a small child HIDES behind a parent’s leg ...
Cooper approaches, and the family parts to let him see an
ELDERLY WOMAN, lying in the bed, FRAIL.
She looks up at Cooper. Delighted. Tears of joy. She reaches
up to him ... he takes her hands.
                       COOPER
          Murph.
                       MURPH
          Dad.
               (To the others.)
          Please.
Her voice is a frail whisper. With authority. The family
shuffles out. Cooper watches them go, turns back to Murph.

                    COOPER
          You told them I like farming.
Murph smiles, still mischievous. Cooper marvels at her.

                    COOPER
          Murph, it was me. I was your ghost.
                       MURPH
          I know ...

She lifts her wrist - the WATCH is there ...
                    MURPH
          People didn’t believe me, they
          thought I’d done it all myself ...
               (Taps watch.)

                    MURPH (cont’d)
          But I knew who it was ...
                    COOPER
          A father looks in his child’s eyes
          and thinks - maybe it’s them -
          maybe my child will save the world.
                    MURPH
          And everyone, once a child, wants
          to looks into their own dad’s eyes
          and know he saw. But, usually, by
          then, the father is gone. Nobody
          believed me, but I knew you’d come
          back.
                    COOPER
          How?
                    MURPH
          Because my dad promised me.
Cooper is crying now.

                    COOPER
          I’m here now. I’m here for you,
          Murph.
Murph is shaking her head.

                    MURPH
          No parent should have to watch
          their child die. My kids are here
          for me now. Go.

                    COOPER
          Where?
                    MURPH
               (it’s so obvious)
          Brand.
And the family comes back in as Cooper releases Murph’s
hand, stepping back to let Murph’s kids and grandkids swarm
over her ... He watches them, their love, as if from another
dimension. A man out of time. A ghost.

                    MURPH
               (V.O.)
          She’s out there ...

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DAY
Brand, in suit and helmet, stands watching Case excavate a
pod, buried under a massive rock fall. She is crying.
                    MURPH
               (V.O.)
          Setting up camp ...

EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - NIGHT

MECHANIC finishes looking over one of the sleek new Rangers.
He packs his tools and heads out.
A figure unfolds itself in the shadows - Tars. He picks his
way through the shadows, unlocks the door. Cooper DARTS in
...

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DAY
Brand kneels in front of a small CROSS. Edmunds’ nameplate
hangs from it.
                    MURPH
          ... Alone in a strange galaxy ...
She unseals her helmet - PULLS IT OFF ...


INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - NIGHT
Cooper and Tars scurry down the line of sleek ships. Cooper
points - Tars starts working the hatch mechanism, while
Cooper KEEPS WATCH ...

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DAY
Brand, helmet off, BREATHES. And breathes again.

                    MURPH
               (V.O.)
          Maybe, right now, she’s settling in
          for the long nap ...
                                                     156.


INT. RANGER IN HANGAR, COOPER STATION - NIGHT
Cooper STRAPS into the pilot’s chair, Tars beside him. The
outer doors slide open. They look out at the inky blackness
of space ...


EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DUSK
Brand looks at the setting sun ...

                      MURPH
                 (V.O.)
            By the light of our new sun ...

INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - MORNING

The Mechanic opening up, walks along the row of ships until
-
One is MISSING.


EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DUSK
Brand turns from the dwindling light ...
                      MURPH
                 (V.O.)
            In our new home.
She heads down through the twilight towards camp. And we -
Fade out.
